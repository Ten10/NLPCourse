<subject>How to handle a 1.5 year old when hitting?</subject><content>Hi,&#xd;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our 17 month old has started hitting, we don\'t believe in physical discipline. Any tips other parents would recommend?&#xd;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We currently tell him "no hitting", "hitting hurts", and he kind of gets it. But sometimes clearly that doesn\'t help much...particularly when he\'s frustrated.&#xd;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Any tips?</content><maincat>Parenting</maincat>

<subject>How do I get rid of my California ant problem?</subject><content>Ever since I moved to California, I've been battling ants in my kitchen. I'm very careful to wipe up spilled food, which helps. I have to keep food for my cats on the floor, which they somtimes spill on the floor, so that's not so good. But I can't not keep food out for them when I'm gone. I've tried caulking up crevices the ants are coming in through, but this seems to be a losing battle because there's always another crevice. Also, I put ant stakes outside my house along the wall they come in through, to no avail.</content><maincat>Home</maincat>

<subject>How to determine primality as quickly as possible?</subject><content>I know the easiest way of determining if an integer X is prime is to try every integer Y up to sqrt(X), and if X modulo Y = 0, then X is composite. That's very basic.&#xa;&#xa;What I want to know is, how do I test for primality faster than this? It's easy to generate a prime number - they're found at N!+1 where N is a positive integer. For instance, 9996!+1 is an extremely large prime. One would think the inverse of this function would be simple, and it is... but not all primes are found this way. For instance, 5 is prime but 4 is not the result of a factorial.&#xa;&#xa;So... what's the quickest way to determine if a number is prime (especially in a computer program)?</content><maincat>Science</maincat>

(I thought space &amp; time aren\'t absolutes, but the speed of light/laws of physics are)&#xa;&#xa;Physicists say there\'s no preferred "frame of reference" (the laws of physics should hold no matter how you\'re moving) so depending on where you are, and how fast you\'re moving compared to other parts of the universe, wouldn\'t the age (and size) of the universe differ?&#xa;&#xa;(i.e. if you\'re moving close to the speed of light, wouldn\'t the age of the universe seem shorter?  Or if you\'re moving "as little as possible" I mean... if you\'re "still"(?) compared to, say, the ether...?  I thought the ether didn\'t exist)&#xa;&#xa;Any explanations or references would be greatly appreciated.&#xa;&#xa;Thanks!</content><maincat>Science</maincat>

My dad is always supportive no matter what.  How do I balance this?</content><maincat>Relationships</maincat>

<subject>How can I make my life better? I'm not in love w/ my g/f , and she is using our daughter to keep me with her.</subject><content>IN A NUTSHELL she (my girlfriend of 5 years) has told me if we break up I'll never see my daughter again. If I don't marry her she'll leave me. My girlfriend yells at my daughter and swears all the time, has no manners, is irresponsible, rude, selfish, inconsiderate, lazy, and has a horrible family history. I have given her 5 years of my life and gotten nothing in return (other than a beautiful daughter) I get no respect. I am raising my daughter by myself, my girlfriend lets her do what ever she wants, regardless of my say in the matter. I want to be happy in my life and not miserable every day. I want to leave her but at the same time I want what's best for my daughter. If that is marrying the girlfriend and staying with her, that is what I will do, but I wont be truly happy. Ever. And this is an awful thing to say but I know I could find my daughter a better mom.</content><maincat>Relationships</maincat>

It was her favorite musical. It was the last musical she ever took us to.&#xa;I told my cousin that now my second favorite musical is Rent, and that my first is Wicked. She asked if there were any other plays that I had cried at. I said I almost cried at Phantom, but it isn't one of my favorite musicals...I've never truly been able to love the music. I like it...but not in the same way I do Wicked or Rent.&#xa;She got mad, and we fought, but it got me to thinking...how many people judge a movie or a play based on who they were with/the time the had during it. And how many people can set that aside and judge based solely on the movie or play itself. &#xa;So, which way do you do it?</content><maincat>Entertainment</maincat>

<subject>How can I report a postal worker for thieft and misconduct?</subject><content>I moved here two and a half years ago and I\'ve paid for my post office box on far to many occassions.  At first I just let it slide saying to myself "I\'ts only $20.00" but then I realized, if it\'s being done to me than who else has fallen victim to this seemingly sweet kind good natured gal?  So I\'m searching my heart and my computer for the right answer.  I question my faith and obediance to God first and know that I cannot afford to be unforgiving, however I have given my shirt,skirt,and shoes to this woman and now it\'s got to stop. Sure you can get rich stealing other peoples money or mail, but you won\'t get to heaven being a liar (Check your Bible), what I\'m saying has been written for centuries.  My carnal nature would like to say a few words to her but the God I serve is busy enough cleaning up the mess I\'v made I\'d hate to ask him for forgivness for something I don\'t ever have to do. Vengance belongs to only God so I need not worry about what he has planned for her. JUST REPENT!</content><maincat>Politics</maincat>

Without realizing it i've become more and more co-dependent over the years, to the point that my life is pretty much in shambles (but not hopeless).  I'm a shell of the person I was seven years ago. Feels like I'm just hanging on by my fingertips, and I have two boys,7 and 8, that I've pretty much raised by myself and I cannot let this go any further for their sakes. I just don't know what steps to take. Getting away from her might help a lot but I've done plenty to get myself into this mess. I've become very adept at isolating myself and avoiding confronting a problem head on in hopes it will just disappear. I was never like this before.</content><maincat>Health</maincat>

He never snored in 8 years of marriage until 6 months ago.  He\'s in his mid 30\'s, is extremely fit and is at or below his ideal weight, and has had no change in health.  He says the snoring is because he\'s "exhausted."  It\'s true that he is working longer hours these days.  But in any case, the snoring needs to stop!

(see details)?</subject><content>There\'s something in my science textbook about Taxol, a substance taken from the bark of some sorta yew tree yadda yadda yadda, and it\'s given to cancer patient. It supposedly creates a sort of "cage" around cancer cells to stop them from reproducing, and reduces tumors this way. &#xa;&#xa;I thought a tumor was a mass of cancer cells that formed together. Does the taxol "cage" form around the whole tumor or individual cancer cells? But if taxol just stops the cells from reproducing, how does it make a mass of them smaller, or how does it form around every tumor cell if it\'s one big mass? &#xa;&#xa;Am I wrong about everything here, or have I just forgotten one thing? Is this just a big deal about a simple answer? Please reply if you know, I\'m very confused over here!</content><maincat>Science</maincat>

<subject>How can a gay man learn to date women? part 2?</subject><content>All people are not 100% straight or 100 %gay. Many are part straight &amp; part gay,then they learn to act 100% straight and are accepted by straight people or learn to act 100% gay and are accepted by gay society. Straight girls may like a gay man as a friend, but not as a lover. A woman may do more work when building a relationship with a man, but only after she has gotten to know him and has decided she wants him. It is the man's job to meet a woman, take her out on a date, and call her and ask for another date. When I was young I was drop dead cute, so guys were doing everything to form relationships with me, so I never learned how to do the things that are needed to start a relationship. When you are in a relationship with a gay man, you take the risk that you may get aids from him. This is a problem you must deal with if your gay, but you can avoid it you are bi and can learn how to be straight. I'm not gay enough that I want to become my kids mother.</content><maincat>Relationships</maincat>

<subject>How can a bisexual learn to become a heterosexual?</subject><content>When I was a teenager I was introverted, and did'nt have friends until some gays that I met at school started dating me because I was cute. I wanted to date girls also but they thought I was gay and I might have aids so I had no success with them. Recently I got a new job and moved to a different state where nobody knows me, so I want to meet a woman and get married. I have never asked anyone for a date. Men have always asked me,because of my looks. I was not able to meet any girls who seemed to like me. I would not cheat on a wife or fiancee with a gay man or any other type of person. I would make a better husband than a straight man who would date a woman who was older than 30. How can I learn the social skills one needs to get a woman to go out with me? There is no anti-gay hidden agenda here. I dont tell gay people that I'm bi, even though they assume I'm 100% gay,which is a dishonest behavior that I think I should stop.</content><maincat>Relationships</maincat>

What is the most effective and *gradual* way to administer it?  How does this impact circumcision, which is traditionally done 8 days after birth in the Jewish faith?  If blood clotting is compromised before administration is complete, when should circumcision be postponed until?&#xa;&#xa;Some sources:&#xa;&#xa;http://www.google.com/search?q=%2Bvitamin-k+%2Bleukemia&#xa;http://books.google.com/books?lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=%2Bvitamin-k+%2Bleukemia+%2Bnewborn&amp;btnG=Search&#xa;http://www.babyreference.com/VitaminKinjectORnot.htm&#xa;http://www.mercola.com/2004/may/26/vitamin_k_injections.htm&#xa;http://www.drfeder.com/children/vitaminK-newborns.htm&#xa;http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminK/&#xa;http://www.larkfarm.com/AP/vitamink.htm&#xa;http://aappolicy.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/pediatrics;112/1/191#top &#xa;http://www.healthychild.com/database/are_vitamin_k_shots_necessary_.htm</content><maincat>Parenting</maincat>

Another lie we've been sold is that capitalism is the only way, when history proves that it never works.  Every single time capitalism is used, wealth ends up in the hands of a few while everyone else struggles.  Corporations own us all now, including our government.  The entire structure of society has to change and it can, it's simpler than it seems.  How do I help get the word out, get people reading Noam Chomsky and other erudite truth tellers, free people from the rat race of work, consume, ad infinitum?</content><maincat>Politics</maincat>

<subject>How to cope when a spouse becomes an atheist after many years of believing? The church was our foundation.?</subject><content>We married young and both shared a deep commitment to the Lord and our church. She left the church and says that she doesn't believe in God at all any more. She says she just left the church; she's not leaving me. My paradox is that I feel like I can't leave her because of my beliefs re: marriage and divorce, but if I weren't in church, I probably would because it feels like we are headed in different directions. However, if I weren't in church we wouldn't be headed in different directions! Also, where does my responsibility as the head of the home come in when she is doing things that I feel like are destructive to her or to our marriage? I feel like it would be wrong to push her away, but I can't just let her destroy herself either. Thanks for any help you can offer.</content><maincat>Relationships</maincat>

<subject>How do you increase affordable workforce housing in a high growth, yet low wage, area?</subject><content>I live in St. George, Utah (the second fastest growing metro area in the country according to the US Census Bureau a few months ago).  Thus, housing prices are high (not as bad as some parts of the USA) while wages are low.  People who accept jobs here cannot afford to live here unless they have a lot of money coming into the area.  The real growth industries are construction and service, and those usually aren't that high of paying.  To compound this problem, a lot of retirees with money retire here, Southern California cash out their equity in their Californian homes and move here with money, and investors with money buy properties to rent.  That does not help the worker who has no money and not a high enough wage to buy a house.  Many commute to Las Vegas about two hours away since wages are higher there.  Any ideas on how to allievate this problem?</content><maincat>Business</maincat>

<subject>How do I cop with my feelings?</subject><content>I just had a baby 9 months ago by my ex-boyfriend and he was supportive at first but now he ain't doing nothing. I was so angry at one point that all I did when I saw him was curse him out. at a time I came to a peace with him and the anger was gone and it was just hurt that he wouldn't want to help me with my baby, I just recently found out that he is with a lady that we both knew but he was most cool with, and taking care of her children, kids that are not even his. Now there's anger again. At what point will this pain, anger and rage go away? I try not to think about it but it hurts so bad because I really cared about him. so my question is am I hurt because he's with someone we both know and helping take care of kids that ain't his or because he just ain't helping me with the one he made with me and what do I do about making him take responsibility and getting rid of my pain? I've tried child support already and he just recently started selling illegal drugs.</content><maincat>Relationships</maincat>

He's been like this all his life, &amp; usually I just try to hold him &amp; comfort him; but it makes me feel so bad, &amp; useless. I'm sure the vet could possibly give him something for his nerves, but, that's money that I really don't have unfortunately. Is there anything I can possibly do to help his nerves &amp; calm him down when these incidents occur?.

I appreciate a dog that will give one or two warning barks if someone is approaching our apartment, but this dog seems hypersensitive to every little sound, even within our own home.</content><maincat>Pets</maincat>

<subject>How to deal with ex\'s "discipline" of a 6 year old?</subject><content>My boyfriend and I have been together nearly a year now, he has a 5 (turned 6 today) year old daughter. Mom spoils the girl to extremes, buying her stuffed animals for no reason at all. Everytime she comes to see her dad she has a new stuff animal. She can be a real brat too. I know its a kindergarten thing, but mom lets her get away with everything. Not finishing food, not paying attention, not doing what youre asked, etc. She flat out ignores us sometimes. How can we reverse this without wreaking havoc on her. She is already having enough to deal with just the fact her parents are divorced. She knows she is not allowed to get away with those things when she is with us but she keeps trying. Also, how do you deal with the "I miss my mommy" whining when she gets in trouble for stuff (you know she misses her because she wouldnt have got in trouble for it at her moms).

Our road and drive is gravel (well, some gravel) and it frequently gets potholes.  Mr. Landlord won't grade it very often, and I'm wondering if I could use QuickCrete or some type of patchine material to fill the holes.&#xa;&#xa;It rarely freezes here, but we get snow a couple of times a year.  It rains all the time, so it's got to be something pretty waterproof.&#xa;&#xa;Putting loose gravel in the hole works for about ten minutes, and then cars kick it all out.</content><maincat>Home</maincat>

However, the company moved to another location and the person they assigned  to  market my book was not open to any of my ideas for the demographic I was trying to reach.. In fact I was todl no one would be interested in my book becasue I wasn't famous.  However, people become famous becasue other pay attention is what I thought.  So now my novel is on four websites and I am spending extra money to find out how I can become a guest on radio talk shows to sell more books.  Meanwhile the publisher refuses to answer any of my questions when it comes to royalties.  And they were paid up-front.&#xa;I put my life saving into paying for this book and spent seven years writing it.  Can someone help me get my book positively notice without kicking my dreams in the teeth?</content><maincat>Arts</maincat>

<subject>How can I get my genie to work again? (I think it has crashed)?</subject><content>I recently purchased a genie lamp from eBay. For a while everything went normal: I rubbed the lamp, the genie granted me three wishes. &#xa;&#xa;I made my first wish, which the genie granted. However, at the second wish the genie halted, and stopped responding. I waited for some time but it did not come back on.&#xa;&#xa;I tried everything: I rubbed the lamp, opened and closed the lid, put oil in it. Nothing helps: I think my genie has crashed.&#xa;&#xa;I called the seller, he told me he sold it as is, so he doesn't provide any warranty. He told me it's normal since the genie was in the lamp for over ten thousand years. He told me to give it some time.&#xa;&#xa;What do you suggest I do? Should I call BGB (Better Genie Bureau) or should I sue the seller for the product?</content><maincat>Electronics</maincat>

Unfortunately I have a problem meeting respectable men lately. I am hoping it is not because of the friends I hang out with. Although, I am afraid I need to meet more girlfriends to go out with instead of a group of guys and girls. It is difficult to meet people when I live small town. Although, I know it is possible to meet great people when living in a small town. &#xa;I think I may need to work on my social skills. Some people have told me that their first impression is that I am intimidating. I have been working in a strongly male-dominated field for the past few years and I learned I needed to be assertive to be heard. Is there a way to soften my look and personality and be approchable while still being assertive?</content><maincat>Relationships</maincat>

I don\'t have any problem with that". But, out of curiosity, I asked her to translate her last name to her native language and she couldn\'t \'cause it was her ex-husband\'s last name. I felt so sad, so humiliated and so angry at the same time...I so wanted to scream at her and call her names but I just didn\'t do it. She claimed that she feels it\'s like HER OWN last name and nobody else\'s. According to her, she hates her real last name  and her father who  never took care of her. But, REMEMBER, her ex was NOT a good man either...he cheated on her.</content><maincat>Relationships</maincat>

<subject>How can I fix a cats broken leg at home?</subject><content>Last night I was driving home from the grocery store and there was a beautiful cat sitting in the middle of the highway. I stopped to find that she had been hit by a car and seems to have a broken leg and was freezing. After going to several houses on that road to see if it was anyones cat and several phone calls to neighboring homes from one of the home owners,to no avail,it seemed to be a stray. So I brought her home. ( I have 4 cats of my own) I gave her some warm milk and some food, which she did eat(was very hungry). To get to the point I can not afford to take her to the vet as I am laid off at this time and have very limited funds. I also don't want to take the cat to the shelter to be put to sleep, its a very pretty cat. Does anyone have any suggestions as to how I can fix her up at home. She seems to be resting comfortable at this time.&#xa;Thanks for any help!</content><maincat>Pets</maincat>

<subject>How do I get my husband to see that marriage is a commitment?</subject><content>We have been married two years. He'a 10 yrs. my sr. We have had troubled times, mainly caused from his part-time job. He owns a successful company but still insists on working at a bar on the weekends. I feel as if there is no time left for me or my son. Every holiday and spare minute he is involved with the club. This has left me feeling resentful and angry. I feel that family should come before one's own personal satisfaction...especially in this situation. On Sunday's he is hung over and sleeps all day. If I bother him he becomes angry and we fight. Mon. thru Fri. he works at the company and on weekends he parties at the club. Meanwhile I stay home with our son and feel completely invisible and alone. He says that the part-time job is a break for him. When do I get a break? Am I being selfish to want a spouse that's involved in our family? Am I selfish to want my husband home?</content><maincat>Relationships</maincat>

<subject>How can I get our 3 year old in her own bed?</subject><content>My daughter has slept with us, off and on, since the day we brought her home from the hospital. I love having her close but I hate waking up in the middle of the night with a foot in my back, etc. I can\'t get her to sleep in her own bed by herself, all night long, more than once or twice a month. She\'ll sleep in her bed for 3 - 5 hours, then wake up and come in to our room. Most of the time, she just climbs right over one of us so we don\'t even know she\'s there until the morning. Any suggestions on how to keep her in her own bed would be great! She doesn\'t take naps anymore so it\'s not possible to cut those out, and gets plenty of exercise and a healthy diet. I\'ve tried the "big girl" bribes but she either doesn\'t care or doesn\'t understand.</content><maincat>Parenting</maincat>

<subject>How can I a fix WWII era silk blouse that got put in the washer (colors bled) Or where can I get it fixed?</subject><content>My grandpa recently gave me a few sets of silk clothing that he got while in Japan during WWII. The tags said hand made in china, and they are both silk.  When I returned from a New Year's Eve party my mom told me she had had the brilliant idea to put these antique heirlooms into the washing machine.  I really thought she was kidding but no such luck. Anyway my favorite article of clothing was the one to receive the most damage.  It was a silk blouse mainly off white but with a red collar and red fabric loops that work like buttons.  The red bled heavily into the off-white around the collar and button things, and there are other little red spots littered across the rest of the blouse.  Is there any way to get the red out of the off white?  Or are there places that can professionally repair the garment and reverse the damage my mother did.  I don't know the first thing about clothing or antiques, but these were important heirlooms just entrusted to me and I really want to save them.</content><maincat>Home</maincat>

The supply voltage across the whole circuit is 9V.  The ammeter is placed to measure the current in the circuit, while the voltmeter measures the voltage across the constantan wire.  The length of the constantan wire is increased.  Of course, its resistance would increase proportionally.  This would mean that the current would decrease while the voltage remained the same, no?  I've done an experiment in which the voltage varied.  I don't understand why, as I would think that the supply voltage would always equal the voltage across the constantan wire (as long as its the only component in the circuit).</content><maincat>Science</maincat>

<subject>How Do You Feel About Being "Politically Correct"?? Have We Gone Too Far??</subject><content>This country has become soo "Politically Correct" about everything.

They\'re talking about taking "In God We Trust" off of currency all becuase it\'s forcing a Christian\'s belief on non-Christian folk. IF you think about it the way they\'re changing this country with politics they\'re changing it to make Christians stop being proud about their religion just to make non-Christian folk happy.

She plays with all the other cats including the one peeing.  The cat peeing is a torte and very jealous but she just started this.  We give her extra love and attention but we are nearing our wits end as the peeing is now an everyday occurance, on our sofa.  We have tried keeping her in a spare room at night and during the day but she finds a way to pee almost as soon as she gets out.  Anybody thats been through this and has any advice please let me know.  I'm not getting rid of either cat so thats not an option.&#xa;&#xa;Thanks,&#xa;Kurt</content><maincat>Pets</maincat>

I feel lost and alone...he was everything to me and our son...especially to me.  I have lost my lover, companion,best friend,hopes, dreams and the father of my son.  He brought so much to my life...and then suddenly one morning without warning it is all gone.  I feel lost.  I have a career that I had prior to meeting him, but that means nothing to me now.  Counseling? and Meds? hasn't helped and won't go there respectively....no amount of counseling or meds will bring him back.  And I don't want to feel numb under the influence of meds....What to do?

I am in great need for more responses to the following three questions.&#xa;Maybe it is a boring and troublesome task for you to answer them, but I really look forward to y our reply. Thank you for taking your time. &#xa;Question 1: Suppose you were the general manager in the big company. The employee A is very busy with several projects. For the reason of working efficiency, the general manager turns over one of  his projects to the employee B at the meeting without informing the employee A  before the meeting, so the employee A felt hurt and losing face. Now what would the general manager say to the employee A ? &#xa;     Answer to Q1:&#xa;&#xa;Question 2: Suppose you were an employee. A private phone makes you late for an important meeting in your company. What would you apologize to the boss?&#xa;&#xa;Answer to Q2:&#xa;&#xa;Question 3:  suppose you are a parent. One day, your child, a third grade primary school student, asks you a math problem that you have taught him several times. And that day ,you are not in a mood, you lose your temper to your child . When you calm down, you realize your rude attitude. What would you make an apology to your child?&#xa;&#xa;Answer toQ3:&#xa;&#xa;Thank you for taking your time again.

Is is possible that religion is created to both soothe humankind during it's existence on earth as well as control unruly behaviour???&#xa;(during ancient, medieval and even primitive times there was very little moral coda and religion has allowed for a baseline of ethics to be followed throughout history).</content><maincat>Arts</maincat>

I\'m very analytical, inquisitive, and straight forward. I\'m comfortable being left brained but when I use my right brain (rarely) I can be very entertaining because of my perfectionist nature. I\'m somewhat serious and goal oriented. Sometimes, I\'m so serious I\'ll say something that is funny except I don\'t realize it until others are laughing. I\'m also kind of one track minded. I like to do something and put my all into it kind of like "Forrest Gump". Hopefully, I don\'t end up like Forrest waiting decades for my true love. Help!</content><maincat>Relationships</maincat>

Does anybody have a method to force myself to do my homework earlier, therefore giving me freedom for the rest of the day and not being tired in the morning?&#xa;&#xa;Thanks</content><maincat>Education</maincat>

<subject>How can I help my mom deal with some issues regarding her adoption?</subject><content>My mom has known that she was adopted since she was five or so.  Her adopted mother told her the place that she was born and as time went on, my mom learned little details at different times such as both of her parents names, etc.  Last year, she got in touch with a search angel who found two individuals that she believes are her birth mother and birth father.  Her birth father has agreed to meet her sometime.  However, when the search angel called her mother, her mother advised to never call the number again.  I can understand that it must be difficult for her birth mother to face some issues almost 48 years later after giving her daughter up for adoption, but I believe that my mom has experienced some feelings of rejection regarding her mother's reaction.  Can someone offer some advice about helping my mom through this difficult discovery?  Thank you!</content><maincat>Arts</maincat>

<subject>How do you hook up a stereo system to a PS2?</subject><content>I remember back around 2001, when PS2 first came out, one of my friends(who loved to boast) somehow had all the sound from the ps2 game we were playing(madden 2001) coming out of his stereo system. Not the big ones, the regular ones where it's a 3 or 5 disc changer, with two average size speakers next to them. I think this would be really neat to do, considering I just purchased and RCA Stereo System. I'm not 100% sure if this is still possible to do, and if so what accessories or equipment would I need to hook it up so that if for example, i'm playing Smackdown vs Raw 2006, the sound will come out of the stereos' speakers?

But why is it that everytime the guy sees me when I bump into him alone, he would talk with his friends in a very loud voice as they pass me by, or sing songs aloud, and do so many weird and stupid, and even idiotic things when he is near me. He even muttered "GOT YOU" when he saw me one day and looked down shyly. We weren\'t introduced with each other, but for 8 years he had been like that when we see each other. I felt that he was having a crush on me, but when I and my sister were together, it seemed to me that I should be doubting my conclusion because he seemed to be aloof.... although there are days that he still acts like a clown when I and my sister are together, but I do not know who is the reason why he acts that way! I am very confused!</content><maincat>Relationships</maincat>

<subject>How can I regain trust in my boyfriend who cheated online?</subject><content>We had been chatting for about 5 months and talking on the phone for about 4. We fell in love immediately. I often wrote about us in my 360 blog. He was on my friends list, he had two other women on his. We finally met in person shortly before Christmas and we fell even deeper. About a week after he returned home, I received an IM from a woman asking me if I was in a relationship with him, I said YES! She then told me her name and said she was on his page. She also told me that according to him, he was single and had been trying to get with her for 2 years. She sent me some of what he wrote her and the words were exactly like what he tells me, very graphic and sensual. She also informed me that they had planned to meet for New Years. I was so devastated, so distraught. I thought I had finally met my soulmate. I feel like I cant trust him anymore, though he is trying his hardest to make up for it, I find it hard to belive anything he says. Can trust be rebuilt? We live so far apart.</content><maincat>Relationships</maincat>

A good portion of the time I am left by myself while they goof off big time, or go outside to support their drug habit and get high. If I talk to the manager she just talks to them and they go back to doing whatever they wanted when the manager isn't there anyway. Should I go above them and report them to even higher ups or corporate, or report them to some other agency like the Better Business Bureau or even the police? I have no idea what to do and I can't affort to look for another job at the moment. What should I do?</content><maincat>Business</maincat>

Also too, I could tune it on a dead frequency (no station there) and have a little LED readout on my car saying 'tune to this station for my music' or something like that.&#xa;I'm pretty sure it's because of FCC regulations, but aside from that, how would I acquire/make one that is high power and small and not too expensive?</content><maincat>Electronics</maincat>

<subject>How to bring Gays into the military without discrimination?</subject><content>There are places in the military where relationships will not work.  I spent my time on a submarine that was under water for months at a time.  due to the years of experience it takes to gain the knowledge necessary to operate a nuclear submarine, it's been extremely difficult to integrate women into the sub service.  You cannot operate with the problems relationships would cause.  So what do you do?  Do you allow gays to be open in the military?  If you say yes, please answer how you keep the obvious problems out.  Lovers quarrels, jealousy, etc.  And what about boot camp.  Men, woman, gay men, gay woman.  Are you going to seperate them all?   If you have an answer, aside from holding some sort of law over everyone, what is it?</content><maincat>Politics</maincat>

Before I realized what happened, chunks of skin were dying and peeling off. I used (I know this was dumb, but I had no idea what was going on) a pair of fingernail clippers to remove some of the yuk ... thus infecting the wound with a staph infection. The doctor had to cut away so much of the flesh around the bite that it's never healed properly. Now I have an enormous gash on my arm and I'm uncomfortable wearing sleeveless shirts. &#xa;&#xa;Any ideas of how to fix this problem?

Lil love taps throughout the day to say, " HEY you are mine and I love you" without saying the words. He thinks that cooking for me every night says everything and that should be it. He has been telling me he loves me more often, and I appreciate the efforts!!

Another one wanted to do a home inspection, and I had to agree to "follow-up visits, which will sometimes be unannounced, anytime between 8am and 9pm" after adopting the dog.One wanted my Driver\'s lic number and social security number. Yet another wanted a credit/backround check!!I have had dogs before, I understand pet ownership is not for everyone, but I really think these organizations, while I am sure they mean well, are overdoing it.  I love dogs, but I will not agree to someone causing a problem for me at my job (my boss might think I am looking for another job)or showing up at my house anytime they want and demand to reinspect my house and see my dog.</content><maincat>Pets</maincat>

What I need to do now, is get my footage from the camcorder, into the computer, in a playable format (e.g., AVI or MPG, et.c.). &#xa;&#xa;Now, the camera didn't come with any software. So, I bought all the parts I thought I needed. I bought a FireWire PCI Card for the computer and a 6-Pin to 4-Pin FireWire cable to connect the PCI card and the camcorder together. I'm pretty sure I installed the PCI card right, but I still can't get any indication that the computer knows my camcorder is there. &#xa;&#xa;I have Ulead VideoStudio 9 SE DVD software installed, in case you were wondering. I believe that software is sufficient for transferring my footage.&#xa;&#xa;I need to know what to do from here. Is it a technical problem? Or am I just missing something here?

<subject>How do I overcome what my dad taught me and find a healthy relationship?</subject><content>Ok, my dad was a great dad and man.  He just did stuff that I have not taken well, and I keep placing myself into a lower status &lt;in relationships&gt; because of what I learned from him.  &#xa;&#xa;His stuff: He was a womanizer.  His first wife was an indigent 17 eskamo; he was 35.  His second wife was a philipeano (15 years younger than him).  Sadly, I think he had the worst taste in women.  I look at all the pictures and think he suffered from low self esteme to choose women he had to control &lt;he needed superiority&gt;.  Ironically, these women gave him less controll than a normal american woman (my friends mom\'s)...which is why divorce always happened.&#xa;&#xa;Anyways, men lable me "Exotic", and then I find out they\'re only interested in "Mail order brides"...SO, I\'ve fallen into that loving my daddy but getting bad relationships.

<subject>How do I get back in to college if I have a bad academic record?</subject><content>Here's the back story: I graduated highschool with a great record.  I had excellent grades, excellent test scores (SAT and ACT), and a good extracurricular record to round it off.  Had I applied, I would have had a serious shot at the Ivy League.&#xa;&#xa;However, at age 17, I was struck down with severe clinical depression.  Due to a misdiagnosis and inadequate treatment, I suffered from depression to a debilitating degree for approximately the next 7 years.&#xa;&#xa;Because I was barely able to function a good portion of the time...well...to make a long story short, I ended up going to community college, then transfering to a rather poor (ok, lousy) school and graduating by the skin of my teeth with a Liberal Arts degree.&#xa;&#xa;Now I'm finally receiving adequate, proper treatment for my mental illness and would like to go back to school to study what I always wanted to study (Quantum Physics), but my many F's, withdrawals, and 2.03 GPA won't get me in to any school.&#xa;&#xa;What can I do?</content><maincat>Education</maincat>

He was not elected by the majority of Americans. We chose Al Gore. The supreme court appointed him president. In the 2004 election he did'nt win any primary elections. The repulicans did'nt let anyone challenge him. They made believe they were democrats and voted for Kerry, and the democrats were saddled with an unelectable candidate. Then they put a gay marrige thing on the ballot so people would go to the polls to vote against that, and voted for the more anti gay candidate while they were there.</content><maincat>Politics</maincat>

<subject>How do I do iPod uploading without inadvertantly erasing existing songs on the iPod?</subject><content>OK, I have a 60 GB video iPod. I\'ve only used about 7GB or less so far. I uploaded the songs by first placing the CD tracks into the iTunes library, and then connecting my iPod to the computer. I made the settings automatically update my iPod. &#xa;&#xa;The computer I used for the process described above, we\'ll call "Beryl." It\'s in the United States. I am in Asia. Can I upload new songs onto my iPod using a different computer, so long as I have a copy of iTunes loaded on the Asian computer? I heard that there is a danger of erasing my songs inadvertantly, and I want to avoid this. &#xa;&#xa;How do I make sure not to lose my songs when I try to add new songs, if I am using a different computer than Beryl (original PC originally used to upload my songs to my iPod)?&#xa;&#xa;I\'d like to avoid copying all my iPod songs onto another computer, as 7 GB is not an inconsiderable amount of space (I am using a work computer). So, I guess I am wondering what the correct iPod settings are to accomplish this task.</content><maincat>Electronics</maincat>

I have a small business selling office supplies (similar to Omax and Staples).  But I have no store front and most of my sales are made thru a catalog.  I'm thinking maybe - retail:general.  But I keep no inventory, all sales are on an as needed basis.  Part of me is thinking maybe sales rep, but really it should be retail:catalog, but that is not available.  Thanks!</content><maincat>Business</maincat>

I was replacing a 2-prong receptacle and I couldn't determine which was the hot wire. I assumed I could do this with my multimeter. However either way I connected the multimeter leads to the wires, the meter read +120V. (I guess this is something about AC that I don't completely understand). But anyway.....How can I determine which is the 'hot' wire? It does matter, doesn't it?</content><maincat>Home</maincat>

<subject>How can I get my wife to talk me?</subject><content>It seems as though my wife is never open to talk about issues she has with me.  She has always told me that if I have something to say, that I should just say it and move on.  Most of the time when I ask about something personal, she gets upset or wont even answer me, leading me to believe that I am always the problem.  I admit, and regret, that I have done somethings that have upset her, but I try to explain that it's never my intent to upset her.  I am just tring to find out what the problem is between us and do anything to resolve it.  I try to keep calm and explain how I feel, but I rarely get any feedback, so I have nothing to go by.  And no, I have never cheated on my wife.  I love her so much that I would rather kill myself than ever have an affair.</content><maincat>Business</maincat>

<subject>How do you get a 3-year old to stay in bed &#xa;and go to sleep at night?</subject><content>Our daughter is 3.5 years old. We put her to bed at night around 8, we read for her and sing lullabies. However, she rarely really sleeps before 10-ish and she will get out of bed anywhere from 3 to 15 times and run to us in the living room. Sometimes, she will just turn on the light in her room and sit on the floor playing. We have tried threats, time-outs, taking away toys, denying her candy in the weekend........everything that  we can think of. It's driving us nuts that we don't have anytime by ourselves during the evening and it is bad for her in the long run to get too little sleep. Who has experience with this situation?

<subject>How to troubleshoot the  1 hp jet pump ?</subject><content>Hi, I've been using a 1 hp jet pump(for the past 7 years)for lifting water from the shallow well to the overhead tank.I've been experiencing lot of problems due to the excessive hardness of the well water &amp; my motor strucks many times.But this time it is not the problem due to hardness of water.My pump does not starts very often(for example, if I put this evening,it works but the next day it is not starting at all) .When I checked the capacitor(keltron 12.5 MFD 440VAC 50 Hz),it is ok &amp; the coil is not burnt.This time I didn't want to spend more for the technician &amp; removed the capacitor(myself) &amp; checked &amp; refixed it,to my surprise it worked for 3days &amp; again the pump is not running(there is no jam in the impeller).Again I did the same thing as I did before but the pump is not running.My question is what will be the other reasons for the pump not running if capacitor is good &amp; the coil is not burnt &amp; there is no jam in the impeller)</content><maincat>Home</maincat>

<subject>How can we start a local outsourcing business?</subject><content>My father, a network engineer, is part-owner of a corporation, whose sole business right now is to provide manpower (i.e., himself) to a large company's computer network. In other words, the company pays his corporation a lot of money per hour, which pays him a little bit, using the rest to pay expenses pre-tax. This is good for tax savings, but we also want to be able to make more money than one person's hourly rate. I suggested networking between people I know looking for work, and local small businesses who might be looking for manpower for a short-term project, or just can't find good employees. I figure people I refer will do a better job, knowing they are helping my family business. My dad says the additional insurance, etc. would make it unprofitable to pay an acceptable wage and still collect a reasonable rate. However, he hasn't actually researched it in depth, so I think it might be possible to find a way. Am I just being naive, or can we accomplish something here?</content><maincat>Business</maincat>

<subject>How can i sell my products(rimless eyeglass frames)?</subject><content>Hi, I have started importing rimless eyewear frames(brandless) from India and China. Now these are great quality and i am giving a one year warranty on these frames. I am ready to sell it in wholesale(min. 10 orders for $30/frame) and to individuals(i am mostly looking for wholesale) for $50. But my problem is that the local retailers who sell these frames(similar frames) for $220 are not ready to buy from me as they say that they want a company backing me up. How do i make a start? What should be my strategy? I truly beleive that the market for frames have a monopoly charging ridiculous prices for frames  and the people deserve much better and cheaper prices and that is the reason i started importing it. Can anyone advice me what my strategy should be and why would the people be/not be interested in a product like this?</content><maincat>Business</maincat>

My girlfriend has a special needs child and has fought her ex for custody repeatedly. Basically the child is receiving therapy and will adapt to their problem someday but because of the custody fights and the therapies legally getting the courts to allow her to move here is just as difficult. We don\'t want to deprive our ex\'s of visitation but we also want a life for ourselves and to be together. Suggestions?</content><maincat>Relationships</maincat>

<subject>How can we infer as to whether a dream (or a series of dreams) is Prophetic or Precognitive?</subject><content>Actually why is posed the query is that I had a series of dreams detailed below: I had a dream that one of my close friends was driving his car and a truck came in front of it. I was not sure whether the collision took place or not as I woke up soon after with a shock and cry. I dismissed it as a nightmare and again dozed off. My real trouble began a fortnight ago when I had the second part of the same dream \xe2\x80\x93 I went to his place and escorted his wife, I his wife and kids were all gloomy and crying. I could not see him as to whether he survived or not, but one thing is sure that he really met with a serious accident. &#xa;&#xa;Now, the worst part is that he is a regular commuter between two cities (approx 70 Km apart) and the highway is also busy without a divider i.e. the possibility of the dream coming true cannot be ruled out. &#xa;&#xa;One of the websites said that it is precognitive while a newspaper article indicated it to be prophetic! I am in a fix. Please help me out.</content><maincat>Business</maincat>

I am 25 and will be 26yrs old in October. I don't know what happened to me, but my clock is certainly ticking big time and it has cause me great pain that my husband is too afraid to start a family with me. His only excuse is that he's not ready, but he won't say why. I tell him no one is ever ready. They just take it on. We are not poor, so a baby would not kill us. I've sacrified everything for him, including moring accross the country away from my family so he could work where he wanted. &#xa;&#xa;I think this is the next natural step in our marriage. I want to nurture a child an stop babying him. I've stopped sleeping with him because to me w/o procreation, it's pointless and depressing. What do I do to make him understand how important this is to me? He's just being selfish.</content><maincat>Parenting</maincat>

<subject>How should I file: dependent or independent for FAFSA?</subject><content>I live with my mother but she doesn't file me on her taxes, we file our taxes seperately. I currently don't have a job @ the moment but I did work last year for a couple months. I'm not a minor &amp; most of the colleges here would consider me an adult student since I'm over the age of 21. So I was thinking if I did FAFSA on my own I'd get more money for school. I'm not entirely sure, but my mother might make too much money. And I don't want a small amount of aide or none @ all b/c of that. I haven't applied to any schools or FAFSA yet, I'm just trying to get an idea of this process. So basically can I file FAFSA on my own w/o my mother's financial info, even though I live with her? And do you get more aide when filling it out that way?</content><maincat>Education</maincat>

<subject>How can I afford to buy a new laptop, on a limited budget?</subject><content>My old laptop just died, and I am considering options to purchase a new notebook computer.  From my research, I am interested in purchasing an HP Pavilion DV4015CL Notebook. It retails for US $1,699.99.  &#xa;&#xa;I am on a limited budget, having just started a new job, and I am trying to consider options for how to legally finance this purchase. Does anyone have any ideas? I don\'t want to say "I can\'t afford this",because it doesn\'t help my situation. My philosophy is that when you ask "how can I afford this?", it provides you with more options to think outside the box, and is not so limited or self-defeating. &#xa;&#xa;Any ideas or suggestions will be welcome. For instance, I thought about investing in stocks, but I don\'t know too much about that.</content><maincat>Business</maincat>

I went to my lawyer they said no way out with out going out of business. Some one wants to buy my business but doesn't want to be part of the franchise. With out the royalties it's worth more. The franchise's royalties are putting me out of my house and home and forcing me to work 50 hours a week at less than $7 an hour or worse and soon I will have to close so I can get a job. The franchise won't budge on the royalties, they'd rather see their franchisees go out of business. I don't know what to do. I've never closed a business before, what happens when you do? The franchise agreement says if I close I have to pay them for 6 more years.</content><maincat>Business</maincat>

<subject>How can I get my children to help me around the house?</subject><content>I am a single mother of nearly 15 year old twins that refuse to help around the house.  The girl is in cheerleading and is an exceptional student in school who says she now needs a tutor for math, which the school won't help with.The boy plays video games, and refuses to even bring home any homework, let alone do it, but gets A's on every test in school.  I own my own salon and am alone with only help from a shampoo girl and have to work M - Sat from 10 to 9 and sometimes later.  Both children refuse to help with chores at home, and are realistically the only ones home making the mess in the first place.  The mess is piling up and I don't have time or the energy to keep up with all of it without going mad.  I just had to close my shop last Saturday as I was in the hospital because I was so over-worked.  There is no way to enforce any punishment on the children as no one is home with them (another conundrum).  I want my children to become productive, self-nourishing adults</content><maincat>Arts</maincat>

There is this one guy I met while getting a tattoo in this shop and yes, he works in the shop as a piercer and I feel sort of giddy and nervous around him. I do really, really like a lot but I don't know anything too much about him and i think he is sooo hot,though some friends of mine don't think he would be attracted to someone like me as girlfriend material. I don't go into the shop often because i'm quite busy but i do try to stop by whenever i can. I think the last time I saw him i think i embarssed myself in front of him and he gave me this weird smirk on his face like he was laughin' at me. So i just want to know how i can get over my nervousness and shyness while in a room full of men that i'm interested in and how to know when they also like me in return.</content><maincat>Relationships</maincat>

I aim to be as spiritually strong and emotionally balanced as I can be at all times, but sometimes no matter how supportive I try to be all I get is abuse until, a day or three later, she wants to meet, apologize, get drunk and f#ck.  We have both been in several long term relationships and have a fantastic, relaxed compatibality outside of these incidents, which happen anywhere from once every 4 months to twice a month.

<subject>How do I get my roomate to give away two little dogs that have used the livingroom carpet as a bathroom?</subject><content>I am an animal lover but these two need to find new homes!  They have destroyed virtually every carpet in the house.  It stinks in the house!  My roomate refuses to buy new flooring.(I suggested laminate with area rugs if he kept these dogs. He can well afford it.)I told him they will not quit going since the scent in the carpet now makes them go. The odor cannot be removed, its that bad.  It has been tried. He does not like the dogs that much.  He is only hanging onto them because they belonged to his deceased wife who loved them and because he thinks he will eventually get visitation with his deceased wife's 13 yr. old daughter who also loves them. (Her father will never allow a visitation and that is a guarantee since my roomate keeps telling the daughter her father is not a good person! He cant figure out why her father wont allow visitation either!)  I cant move out right now. If I could afford new flooring, I would replace the floors immediately since this is so disgusting!

There are also those who have been born with physical defects that really disrupt their image. I can take things like cleft pallets and other minute stuff but these other people are extreme. I cannot even look at them without being frightened because it scares me to know that people like them are still living. I cannot bare the fact that God has created such beings. I know they are regular people in mind and soul, but that doesn't seem to overcome the thoughts that generate within my mind. I am mad at myself for being such a wuss and feel sorry for those other people. These unique people have given me an image that frightens me in my nightmares, and it is overruning my life. The only way stop this is to accept these people for who they are but I don't know how.</content><maincat>Social</maincat>

Right now I am unemployed,in a town that I truely don\'t have anyone that I can rely on to truely help if needed,my living situation is I now rent a room in a home that has no real privacy,and my transportation is currently bus,bike,or walk and I can\'t do that after oral surgery.Medical coverage in this state that I live does not cover "cosmetic" procedures and dentures,or bridges,caps,etc. are considered cosmetic.They will pay to pull all your teeth but they will not help get you new ones!! I like to eat.So..What can I do to get my teeth fixed and looking decent so that I can someday again smile.</content><maincat>Health</maincat>

<subject>How do I thank hospital_geek for being so kind?</subject><content>Thank you hospital geek. I assume that you work in the medical field. I am undergoing chemotherapy(is it pronounced interferon?) starting on Feb.06,2006. Any suggestions to prepare for it? I hear I am in for a bumpy ride. I was told it will be an every day thing and I am not going to lie to you -- I AM A SCARED MAN... I have been taking vitamin C, and Coral Calcium(heard on a informirtial that coral calcium cures cancer). I have already undergone the removal of the melanoma metastisized from above my right shoulder blade to below my right bottom rib and they removed all of the lymphnodes under my right arm causing severe nerve damage so My right arm is basically like one whom has had a stroke. I am just sick of the pain and I hear that the chemotherapy is extremely traumatic to the body. Just hoping for some advice if you have some. Once again thank you H.G.&#xa;respectfully,&#xa;               John Perkins</content><maincat>Culture</maincat>

<subject>How to find a former soldier I had romance with 10 yrs ago? Lives in CA but unlisted everything.?</subject><content>When I was in the military I had a romantic relationship with a soldier. We were both military nurses, male-female and neither were ever married. He had 5 yrs to retirement at age 42 and I had 7 yrs to retire at 41, and both are retired now from  military service.  He went into medical teaching in CA and I continued nursing in PA after both were discharged. I kept in touch with him until I met a lovely guy locally, then I quit contacting him and now I regret my actions.  It is now been almost another 10 yrs since my last contact, and I tried to locate him through professional services but have been unsuccessful.  After all this time I realize I never should have left him and wish to find him, if possible, and let him know.  Any ideas as to how to find him.  His former employees, a nursing institution, have no current address or contact with him. I found out he was alive and filed taxes in CA in 2003, single status.  He was originally from my area and all his relatives are deceased.</content><maincat>Relationships</maincat>

My ex, a wealthy businessman does not give enough child support for our kids.  I don't work as I am taking care of 4 kids.  My husband, a working man helps with the support, yet my kids disrespects him. We are just living paycheck to paycheck.&#xa;&#xa;2. My kids treats their dad n his wife with more respect than they do to me n my husband. They have lately became more closer with their dad and step-mom than with us.  This hurts as I and husband sacrificed a lot so my kids can be with us.  Everytime my kids spends time with their dad, they always came back bratty &amp; disrespectful.&#xa;&#xa;4.  When I left ex due to his abuses, he was not happy as he lost face in public.  I feel he is being vengeful thus all his manipulation to win things on his favor.  Now, he is getting our kids to be on his side, too.  Before my kids wants to be with me, now I am not sure.</content><maincat>Parenting</maincat>

W joined the National Guard, then deserted before completing his enlistment. Rush Limbaugh and O'Reilly were also draft dodgers. Murtha, Kerry, and McCain were decorated war heroes. McCain was a POW and the first victim of Rove's swift boat tactics. Whenever one of these heroes says something that questions the mistakes of these chickenhawk cowards they are attacked and called cowards.

<subject>How do I get a second chance?</subject><content>I"ve had a crush on this girl for 3 years now. I haven\'t lost hope because our moms are best friends. We went out for the first time last month. It was a first time because she just got out of a 3 year relationship that started right around when I met her. I picked her up, and she had no curfew (She\'s 20 with strict parents.) I took her to dinner, and it was good. We talked the whole time and never a dull moment. We are very alike, and she said I was more mature than her ex. She also mentioned that maturity was big with her. So then the movie she wanted to see started in 2 hours. To my surprise she wanted to wait. We then went to some benches and started talking, where I went noble and told everything. It didn\'t kill things as we still talked. On the way home it was quiet because I had never driven freeway at night and she got scared.&#xa;&#xa;We talked that week. The next week, I tried calling and she didn\'t call back. Her bday is next week, and I want to see her. How do I get a 2nd chance?</content><maincat>Relationships</maincat>

<subject>How to make small talks and friends...?</subject><content>This is my first year in college, and I really want to make friends, I mean, in high school, because of my shyness, I didnt' have any friends, I didnt even want to eat lunch because no one would sit with me. Now that I am in college, I really want to make friends for the first time and actually enjoy being in school. So...&#xa;&#xa;How do you make small talks with people? Because when I meet a new person, I always find myself not being able to converse with them. I mean, what do I talk about? Just the normal things, oh, how was your day today, and stuff? But what to say after those run out?&#xa;&#xa;And how to make friends in general? People seem to have no problems meeting new people and making friends, but me, I seem like I am the only one lonely on campus.

These scratches concern me somewhat because I take rather good care of my trumpet [polish it every day] and the look of my trumpet [yes, :) vanity] matters quite a lot to me.  I've heard of a process called re-dipping, but I don't know if such a thing actually exists and how effective it is.  &#xa;&#xa;Basically: Does anyone know of any sort of substance that I could apply to my trumpet to cover up the scratches?  &#xa;&#xa;Example of scratch: One on the main leadpipe.  It is approximately one centimeter in length and rather narrow.</content><maincat>Entertainment</maincat>

There is more than one religion, even, that claims to be the One True Religion.  How do you explain that, and how do your own beliefs support that explanation?

<subject>How can I make my wife tell me the truth about with whom she have sex before our marriage? She said no one.?</subject><content>She got married when she was 18 years old, but her husband died in a car accident one year later, she had active sex life during that year and become widow with one baby. Five years later (2005) she married me (I am 36 years old). When I asked about her past sex life she says she did not have sexual relations with nobody until me in year 2004.&#xa;I can't trust her because that means 5 years of not having sex which seems to me impossible considering human biological needs. I would have trusted her if she told me she had sex with one or two persons during those 5 years but not having sexual relations copulation with nobody is a thing I do not believe. I have told her that there is no difference for me I love her either if she had or not had sexual relations those years but it's a matter of trust and confidence for me.&#xa;How can I convince her or make her tell me the truth?&#xa;Hypnosis?, Any specific way of asking?

Put a couple of dimes in the meter (8 min per dime), but the meter didn't register the coins. Went to get quarters from a store. Took 7 minutes to get back. Got back and saw a ticket on the windshield for a $30 parking violation! Went to the city office and filled a meter check form on the same day (21 Dec.) -- My request was under review until 27 January! Finally they reviewed it and decided the meter is in good working order and I have to pay or attend a hearing, with evidence. Any insight as to how such unfair tickets can be contested and dismissed? How do I know that the meter didn't get fixed between now and then? How can I provide evidence that I'm telling the truth if I didn't have anyone else with me in the car? Is there any point in investing time to appeal and go to the hearing?? Any insights as to how I can fight this would be greatly appreciated!</content><maincat>Transportation</maincat>

I love it so much! In fact I\'ll be sad when people can guess my age and don\'t mistake me for a student.&#xa;&#xa;God loves to use weaknesses in people because it brings him glory.

<subject>How would you explain the Trinity?</subject><content>I am a Hindu, and I believe that there is only one God, but that s/he makes him/herself manifested in many different forms.  I call myself a monotheist, because I believe all the forms/names are ultimately just the One God.  Is the Trinity similar to this?  Or should it be understood in a different way?&#xa;&#xa;In the book of Genesis, The Lord God came to Abraham.  There were 2 angels accompanying Him, but it seems clear from the text that it was God himself who appeared to Abraham.  Also, God appeared as a pillar of fire to the Israelites.  Why can't these forms of God be accepted as other forms of God?  I mean, why is there only a 3-in-1 and not a 5-in-1 God?  Why ignore the pillar of fire, and the appearance of God to Abraham as valid forms of God?</content><maincat>Culture</maincat>

Arnt we all sick of lieing political leaders and only being told what we want to hear? Wouldnt you rather hear the flat out honest truth even if you didnt like it? Im not talking about the war in Iraq, or anything specifically. But wouldnt it be nice if people could be flat out honest about specific veiws, and not ever have to give the run around? I dont like beating around the bush just to save peoples feelings. and thats just the point beating around the "Bush". When our president says theres a reason for going into Iraq, I would have like to here our president say as soon as he made a mistake, "I made a mistake" not try and wiggle his way out of it for months and then say, "yeah i messed up a little" It makes me think he knew what he was wrong, or somthing. Politics should be based on Honor and respect, and not of anything else. But it is, and im sick of it.</content><maincat>Politics</maincat>

I personally know that women have been interested in him.&#xa;&#xa;But he's shy around women and he knows it. He has never been on a single date and he is almost 26 years old. He doesn't know how to approach women and he doesn't try. So women give up and move on. I know this is very frustrating for him but I am a woman myself, and I don't really know what it feels like from a man's perspective. Can anyone offer any really good advice on dealing with this?

How can people believe in stories written thousands of years ago as fact when faced with scientific proof that it did not happen that way? Particularly creationism vs. evolution. We have actual, physical, solid proof that evolution exists and is still in effect. How can someone believe in Adam and Eve? I really and truely don\'t get it. How can someone see something with their own eyes and yet deny that it is true? And why is it that they can believe in that story and yet scoff at the way other religions believe? It\'s like handing someone a copy of Tolkin and teaching them that is the true history of ancient England. Can anyone rationally, and by rationally I mean actual reasons not just "Because the bible says so and so it must be true." tell me why?</content><maincat>Culture</maincat>

Cold galivinizing worked but did not stay adhered.?</subject><content>I make candles and am having a problem with a rust ring forming in my wax after a few days. It only happens with some secents (my most popular) and it seems to be scents that contain any vanilla in the recipe or spice like cinnamon. It doesn't inhibit the burn but looks awful and I want to be able to make up an inventory of candles made up ahead of time but can't with this rusting. I have tried cold galinizing sprays (lightly sanded first for adheasion) but it melts into the wasx while burning. Rustoleum high heat spray didn't adhere even before burning. My wax melts at 124 dgrees F. Any ideas of something I can coat the inside of the tins with before pouring the wax and adheres to the tins well and will hold up to the melting candle?

"For I know the plans I have for you declairs the Lord! Plans to prosper you and not to harm you. Plans to give you a hope and a future." Thats my life verse and one I based my entire life on for years and years and then one day, The Holy spirit told me to read on. I had never read the next few verses before. I always just stopped at verse 11 because that was the goddie part of it. Then I got Holy Spirit slam dunked! The disney ride was OVER spiritually. God totally pierced my heart with this so much and also it showed me why I am still single and don\'t know how to be very intimate. Its because I haven\'t sought after God with ALL of my heart! Read verses 12 and 13 they will absolutly floor you. God\'s heart was crying out to me that "Hey! I gave everything for you and went after you and pursued you, so when are you going to pursue me!". Also thats what woman so need! A man to activly pursue them!</content><maincat>Culture</maincat>

<subject>How to house trained a full grown dog?</subject><content>I have had my dog, a cocker spaniel for 5 years. I found him as a stray.  The vet said he looked about 3-4 years old. I brought him in the house and started training him and he did well, going to the back door whenever he needed to go.  Then my ex and I split up and I moved out about 2 years ago. We lived in apt. for a while and he wasn't too bad. Now, we live with a man who has a female lab that outweighs him by 50 lbs and is fixed. Now he goes wherever he feels like it and marks all the time, and I can't seem to break him of it. I have a fenced in backyard but it has rained and the grass it wet, he won't even get off the sidewalk to go.  I assume it's because he isn't fixed and he's around a female who is, so he's not getting any and rebelling. Even though it didn't seem to bother him before but then again he didn't have a female around to tempt him either.  What to do?</content><maincat>Pets</maincat>

<subject>how to housetrain 2 grown male wienerdogs, who constantly "double mark" eachothers pee spots?</subject><content>I have a 6 year old wiener male, who has always had "potty issues" inside the house. (I have 3 other grown dogs, who are all fine. A year ago, I got another male doxie, who already were house trained, but however started following the other doxies paw steps. Its been a year of hell, and my wooden floors are destroyed. I have tried various repellants and "no go" sprays, with no luck. I have Dug their noses in the pee and trown them outside directly after the accidents. They all have cages, where they are locked up at night. They are all let out in a huge back yard on a regular basis. I have bought them diaper pants, which they  hate. I have given them a tray with pee pads and put cloth with their own pee on it to make them go there - it helps a little, but I still have numerous accidents.

<subject>How do I know if a guy likes me or not?</subject><content>OK there's gotta be like 43 other questions like this but I'm going to ask anyways...&#xa;&#xa;There's this guy in my aviation group (yes a group for air plane lovers lol) and a week and a half ago I asked him if he would like to do something sometime (first time I've ever really gotten the nerve to do that) and he said yes. Well this past weekend we hooked up and hung out at Best Buy (waiting for our movie) then went and saw a movie and ended up driving aimlessly around in the country just talking. I had the most fun I've had in a long time. And the whole time he was such a gentleman. Always opening doors for me and just overall being a really big sweetheart. At the end of the date I told him we should do that again sometime and he sounded happy and was like yeah! &#xa;&#xa;How do I know if he actually wants to do something again and might like me? I'm not meaning he's got to wanna date me or anything. But I don't know how to tell if he's interested in me or not. &#xa;&#xa;PLEASE HELP!!! :-D</content><maincat>Relationships</maincat>
<subject>How do I keep my bikini area hair-free and smooth?</subject><content>My bikini area never looks nice and smooth.  I always have these very unattractive little bumps (like chicken skin), some red razor bumps, and the color of the skin is slightly darker than my leg.  It's so embarrassing!  I've resorted to shaving once a week with better results but still not looking pretty and I don't like letting it grow out.  Tried waxing but gives me very bad ingrown hairs.  I'm Caucasion/Asian mixed so I have light olive toned skin and dark hair.  I also like the Brazilian shape.  My boyfriend loves it when it's freshly shaved and I would like to keep it that way at all times.</content><maincat>Style</maincat>

<subject>How can people best be convinced of the fact that law abiding gun ownership is better for overall safety?</subject><content>It's interesting that many people support gun control out of fear and ignorance.  Studies repeatedly show that supporting concealed weapons carry by law abiding citizens, and ownership of defensive guns by law abiding citizens improves the safety for everyone.  No law will keep criminals from getting guns (if they were worried about laws, would they murder or steal?).  Disarming populations almost universally increases crime.  Violent crime rates in Scotland, England and Australia far exceed U.S. crime rates, and Canadian rates essentially equal ours, despite the virtual banning of guns.  Switzerland with a far higher gun ownership rate, has lower crime.  Where concealed weapons carry laws are eased, crime has never been recorded to increase, but often is demonstrated to decrease.

My middle child, Danny, has, since the day Laura was born, being horrible and unpleasant to his little sister. My oldest, Scott is really lovely to her and plays games etc with her, but Danny is so spiteful with her. Its now got to the stage where she knows how to press the buttons to annoy him(and it doesn't take much..) and takes great delight in winding him up. His temper management failings are also beginning to take him into other areas of conflict too, especially with his mother and I. The annoying thing is that he is angelic at school and one of the most popular people at school, both with the teachers and the other children. He has huge gifts of charisma and humour, when he decides to show it. &#xa;&#xa;Grateful for any and all help. Jonny</content><maincat>Parenting</maincat>

He has three perches - I've been spending alot of time in the room where he is, and I talk to him or on the phone around him, so he hears my voice.  He won't come up to me yet, and when i bend down to get near his cage, he shuffles his feet like he is really nervous.

I don\'t know if he\'s been unfaithful but I see patterns that suggest a problem.  He lied to me about yahcamgirls and messenger a few months ago - told me it was innocent, no nudity, no chat.  I found out that\'s not the case.  I\'m a very game, kinky, sexual person, and I want to share that with him - I wouldn\'t care if he was just looking at porn.  The interactiveness of the webcam stuff makes me worried, and I have to talk to him about it.  I just don\'t know how to approach this without him getting angry/defensive.  AND I don\'t want to get lied to again! It seems that forbidding people to do things only makes them want to do it more, and I\'m not going to say "I forbid you to do this" - simply because that won\'t work.  Guys, do I have any chance of getting through to him here?  Girls, what would you do?  For the record, I have a very active libido and am game to do just about whatever in our sex life.

We did that for about 2 months.  I thought he was trained because he only went on his pad.  We recently opened the doors back up and he immediately started peeing and pooping in those rooms again. We've cleaned the areas thoroughly, but it doesn't seem to stop him.  Why does he do this, and will he ever stop?</content><maincat>Pets</maincat>

<subject>How did Conservatives convince so many Americans that there is a liberal media bias?</subject><content>Why don\'t Liberals ever talk about a Conservative bias. I know it is equally ludicrous, but perhaps it could be equally effective. I mean the average American does not know that the media is in for one thing... THE MONEY. The media is going to report what they think sells. If that means trashing Dems, they do that. If it means trashing repubs, they do that. Further, the media is owned by just a few giant corporations... come on! The Conservative agenda is much more friendly to corporations and big business so, why would the media decide to have a liberal bias? Did the media have a liberal bias toward Bill Clinton? No, when they learned of a massive sex scandal... they dove right in with both feet because people love to hear about that. Sex sells!!! They did not say, "Well, we are liberals so we should try to downplay this". MONEY IS THE PRIORITY, NOT POLITICS.</content><maincat>Politics</maincat>

<subject>How do the different faiths judge the works of Einstein or Hawkins?</subject><content>I'm very curious about this. Please state the religion you're representing.&#xa;&#xa;If you could, the congregational opinions not only on the study of atomic structure, but also the nuclear and quantum theories. These studies support the opinion of athiests everywhere, BUT neither Albert Einstein or Stephen Hawkins have ever said that they could disprove the existance of god. Is there a faction of faith that has studied this in relation to the creation theory? Is it possible to interprete Genesis and the word of god in a more scientific text? Is it possible god was trying to tell us more than we could understand 2000 years ago? I do not believe in the Da Vinci code, but the bible, as illogical as it seems at times, is full of great prophecy. I believe it is not only written in riddles, but wisdom as well.

I have met with several organizations that want to go for federal grants; they do not have their organizations structured so they can be viable and compete for grants. The EDs want me to act as a consultant as well as a writer.  I give the organizations a  detailed written list of what I need in order to write for them-mission statement, objectives, goals, programs, partnerships.... yet they are slow to respond or don't understand the basics.  The non profits have good people working very hard for the benefit of the disabled or children. I truly want to help but cannot create their structure for them.  How can I best help these organizations and write the grants that they need? &#xa;&#xa;I want to write 12 pro bono grants.  It is a way to pay my dues,  serve my community and then, as a disabled woman myself, support my family while working at home.&#xa;&#xa;Thanks, &#xa;non profit grant writer</content><maincat>Politics</maincat>

The problem that I seem to have is most people my age or either non-religious partiers or their fundamentalist Bible beaters who don't know how to do much other than quote scriptures.  I've tried online dating and I've tried asking out people at church.  Why can't I find a normal person that shares my beliefs?

<subject>How to I heal from the death of my yorkie?</subject><content>My little baby Chloe was killed by a car on January 31st. My husband and I had no children and we are having such a hard time dealing with our grief. She was such a part of our routine. I am not ready for another dog so that isn't an option right now. I walked outsite for just a few minutes and didn't even know she followed me. It was pitch black outside. I just feel so guilty and feel like I killed her because of my carelessness.&#xa;&#xa;She didn't go to the road before and I never saw her follow me out the door, she was playing in the living room. I just am haunted by her little face when I found her.&#xa;&#xa;She had such a wonderful, funny personality. Will I ever be able to love another dog like I loved her. Will I ever stop feeling guilty? Will I ever stop wanted to smell her toys? Will I be able to get another Yorkie. My husband says we loved her because of her fiesty attitude and that when we heal some he only wants another yorkie.&#xa;&#xa;I'm just hurting so bad.</content><maincat>Pets</maincat>

<subject>How would you spend your tax dollars?</subject><content>It said last week it would submit a supplemental spending request for $18 billion for hurricane relief for the current budget year and ask Congress for $120 billion to pay for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan for the rest of this year and into 2007.&#xa;The war spending is on top of a nearly 5 percent rise in the Pentagon budget to $439.3 billion for 2007. Bush's budget would also provide about a 5 percent increase in spending at Homeland Security, not counting hurricane-recovery costs.&#xa;&#xa;The administration has said the deficit for this year will top $400 billion, driven upward by the costs of the war in Iraq and rebuilding the hurricane-ravaged Gulf Coast. &#xa; In all, Bush targets 141 programs for elimination or sharp reductions for savings of $14.5 billion next year. &#xa;Because of the huge deficits, the administration will be forced to ask Congress in coming weeks to raise the national debt limit, now at $8.18 trillion. &#xa;http://silverseed.blogspot.com/</content><maincat>Politics</maincat>

<subject>How do I get my two year old to eat anything?</subject><content>My son has NEVER been an eater. In the first year he was all about the milk, crackers, apples, and bananas. He was never open, even as an infant to any type of veggie, meat, or other fruit to be in his mouth. He would get very upset. Now at two all he will eat is sometimes banana, crackers (grahm and other) and yogurt. Everyday I make other choices available to him but he won't even consider them - not mac &amp; cheese, any type of pasta, potato, or peanut butter. He doesn't ever allow them into his mouth. If something hits another food and he accidently gets a taste of i.e. peanut butter he screams and wipes his mouth out. The doctor says he is at adequate weight. I don't know how. I took the dr.'s suggestion to only put food he should eat in front of him with one thing he loves and he will get hungry. After 5 days of adequate fluids(juice and milk)and bits of food I gave in. I want to help him and believe he doesn't know what he is missing for taste. How can I help him?</content><maincat>Parenting</maincat>

<subject>How Can I transfer DV video to DVD without a computer?</subject><content>I purchased a DV cam a while back. I loved the video quality. I wasn't able to transfer the video from a DV tape to a DVD though. When I installed the software, it said that continuing could cause a vatal error. I didn't want to have to buy a new computer, so I decided not to install it.&#xa;&#xa;I want to buy a DV cam again, but I am concerned there will be no way for me to get the video onto a DVD player. I have a Panasonic plasma screen tv and a DVD-VHS recorder, it is an Emerson EWR20V4. Is there anyway that I could transfer the video to a DVD without having to use my computer? I have no need to edit or anything like that. &#xa;&#xa;I just want to be able to play the tapes without having to use the camera so I don't wear it out too fast. I have had four VHS-C cameras in the past 5 years and I am tired of replacing them.&#xa;&#xa;Any help would be greatly appreciated</content><maincat>Electronics</maincat>

So how do they rationalize killing Asians?  And, don\'t they worry that if everyone with lower IQ than them are killed, then they will be the "retards" in the "new society"?&#xa;&#xa;On the same note, I just don\'t get it.  If they think IQ level is a reasonable excuse for hating other people, how come you never see Asians posting racist comments about killing white people &amp; all other races "below" them?</content><maincat>Culture</maincat>

She got pretty fat a few months back, and we have stopped everyone (but her) from feeding her anything other than dog food.  Now how do we stop her from just taking it?

He has lied even bought her a house because she had nowhere to go and still paying the notes now 3rs later. He told me about the girl and that he had formed a bond with her too over the years but never specified how serious it was. He didn't bring his son around me often, but he did from time to time and made it clear after we were married he would make it a point to bring his son around more often. Now after 5 yrs of not even knowing this girl's name, he wants to start bringing her over. He says he can see her separately, because of our history I'm not cool with that either. If I had known from the start I could accept both kids he said he didnt tell me sooner cause I'd leave. What do I?</content><maincat>Relationships</maincat>

(i dont really care if it is, but still...) &#xa;&#xa;how do i let him know im interested without putting myself out there too much. ive been trying to think of reasons to go to his office, but i cant think of any, the class is easy and i would look like a dumbass. any tips on things i can say or do?&#xa;&#xa;I guess i should add that im in college, 21 years old, and hes only a few years older then me... im not looking to fall in love, i just like him. hes not going to go to jail, he just might lose him (temporary) teaching job..</content><maincat>Relationships</maincat>

<subject>How to get refund from uninsured driver at fault?</subject><content>I was involved in a car accident. A drunk driver was driving heat to head, I was avoiding collision, and he hit my car. The police arrested the driver, I also have a witness. The driver didn't have a license, was not the owner of the car, and didn't have insurance. The car owner does have insurance though. I also have insurance, and I am insured from Unisured motorist accidents. However, my deductible is $1000, and looks like the car may be totaled, in which case I am losing a lot of money because the insurance company will use KBB value or something for refund. If the car is repaired, I also  lose, because my car value drops.&#xa;&#xa;What should I do? Is there a way to get my deductible back from somebody? Is the only way to file a suit against the driver? What are my chances of winning? How much does it cost? How should I behave with my insurance company?.... Any advice is highly appreciated.</content><maincat>Transportation</maincat>

I have over 100 invoices daily to date stamp since I didn't get one, I had to write the dates on each and every invoice.&#xa;My hand hurts! I go without a lot of things I need because I know that damn superviser won't approve it. I am the only female minority in my dept. I bought a stamper on my own and went over the superviser and manager's head to have a higher authority reimburse me. I got my money back and they were furious. That comes up in conversation during my review. I keep getting bombarded with more work load. A lot of it being a Planner's work load that my super loves to throw at me because they know I have complained about this guy for following me around at work staring at me. Help!

<subject>How can I stop the peeling on my new tattoo?</subject><content>I got my second tattoo five days ago. It\'s a phoenix design on my lower back, but the skin is peeling in little flakes of color. This didn\'t happen with my first. Just a minor brush against it will cause some skin to fall off (my shirt had flakes all over it yesterday). It is scabbed in some areas, but the rest of it\'s just flaky. I use "Aveeno Non-Scented All Day Moisture" three times a day (which is what the artist told me to use). Is there something else I should try? Will the flaking cause it to look messed up when it heals?&#xa;&#xa;It also itches like a mofo.</content><maincat>Business</maincat>

Remember now guys  that snowy day in the Meadowlands when out of nowhere your hopes of going to a Superbowl where dashed by a blindside hit put on Tom Brady by none other then Charles Woodson to force what seem to be the game winning fumble, unfortunetely because of some ridiculous rule you got another chance. but lets not forget the year you didnt win? oh and thats right getting spanked by the Broncos didnt help either. Enjoy your 2 Titles(not 3 because you didnt earn the first one) because Dynasty you are not.</content><maincat>Sports</maincat>

<subject>How do i stop thinking about a girl who dumped me and we are still friends?</subject><content>We were togather for more than a year. She was totally serious but i wasn't. After craving for me to feel the same way about her for about a year, she finally got fed up and started seeing other guy. When she told me that, a lightening struck me. It was about 5 months ago. I suddenly started feeling for her so much that i can't express. I told her that million times but it was too late. She says we will still be friends. Once she even told me that she doesn't wanna be with that guy either becuase he doesn't treat her right sometimes. Recently she said that she is no longer seeing him. We work togather in the office. It was so hard for me to see her going with him in lunchtime. But she still tells me to forget about her and be a normal friend. I tried to convince her so much that i am not the one before who didn't have any feelings, but feels like she is never gonna come back. I just keep thinking about her. Recently i was even trying to think negative points about her to help me out.</content><maincat>Relationships</maincat>

<subject>How can I help my new girlfriend handle a potentially dangerous stalker?</subject><content>I\'m dating someone who has revealed to me that she\'s currently being stalked by a man she briefly dated over a year ago (they dated/hooked up for about 3 months).  He hasn\'t threatened her physically, but won\'t stop calling &amp; showing up at her place trying to "win her back."  She swears she\'s done/said everything she can think of to make it VERY clear that she\'s not interested and he needs to leave her alone, but he still won\'t quit.  I\'m aware that the next logical step would be for her to get a restraining order, but here\'s the twist - she also knows for a fact that this guy has ties to and has worked for the Russian mafia (in LA) and could potentially have a bad/dangerous reaction if she went to the police.  She doesn\'t want to "stir him up," and is hoping he\'ll eventually just give up, but it\'s been over a year and he\'s still calling/coming by.  I want to help/advise her and don\'t think it\'d be wise to get personally involved, so any advice would be greatly appreciated!  Thanks!</content><maincat>Business</maincat>

It's very nice, but the walls are blank. So, I would really enjoy some advice, about what to put on those walls, or what else to do with/in the room, to make the party more interesting and more fun... I am bringing my PC for the music, some large speakers, and I'm setting it to Party Mode. There will be some remixes, visualisations that go with the music on the monitor, but that's about it so far....So, please, anyone that's got any ideas, I'm dying to hear them!!</content><maincat>Business</maincat>

It violates the very first ammendment! Some say it is just, I say it is just wrong! Not only that, even with the people don\'t believe in God, it is tradition to tell someone merry christmas! Besides, I don\'t see anybody getting mad over "Happy Kwaanza"! Happy hanukah never got under anyones skin! the first ammendment states freedom of speech and freedom to express faith. Not letting someone say merry christmas is against what our founding fathers intended, and maybe that\'s why our economy has gotten so bad. If that\'s the case, though, how can walmart employees even say "happy holidays"? wouldn\'t that offend someone without religion? these people are STUPID!!!</content><maincat>Politics</maincat>

<subject>How can I get a CAT scan or MRI?</subject><content>I had a brain tumor removed 2 years ago.  It is impossible to remove all cancerous cells because they have microscopic tenticles which extend into the brain.  It is standard procedure to have an MRI or CAT scan after surgery to make sure there are no cancerous cells, but I haven't had either.  I went for an ANNUAL check-up with my doctor recently, and he spent very little time with me, not giving me the chance to tell him that I wake up with headaches.  I meantioned not having a CAT or MRI, and he said don't worry about it.</content><maincat>Health</maincat>

<subject>How to protect yourself from the pain of love?</subject><content>I avoided him for weeks because I just didn't feel an instant attraction or any chemistry.  He was persistent and somehow broke through the brick wall.  I fell for him and fell hard.  He was everything I'd asked God for - a Christian, strong, handsome, loving, caring and put me on a pedestal.  I treated him like a prince, respected him, but held him accountable in the areas where he struggled (something he said he wanted).  Just when life couldn't get any better, he decided that God was telling him to go back to his ex who treats him like crud.  The joy was indescribable, but so is the pain...and honestly, even moreso.  I don't think the chance of true love is worth the pain of rejection.  How does one protect themselves from pain of this sort without isolating everyone and turning into the lonliest person in the world?</content><maincat>Relationships</maincat>
<subject>How do you know when to say when in a relationship?</subject><content>My fiance and I have been having problems.  I have caught him talking to women online several times, even though I asked him to not.  As well, there was talk of meeting.  After I thought about it, I told him it was ok to just talk...but nothing emotional, no meeting, and to just keep it on the computer.  I told him as long as he didn't let it interfere with our relationship, then I didn't have a problem with it.  I recently learned that he was talking to someone on the phone.  It makes it worse because she lives only a couple of hours away, and they discussed meeting.  He says he loves me and swears it nothing, that he would never meet anyone and he would never leave me.  For obvious reasons, I have a hard time swallowing that, I just am afraid to end it, and lose him if he is really being truthful with me.  I do love him, more than anyone I have ever been with.  I just don't know what to do.</content><maincat>Relationships</maincat>

<subject>How can you tell whether a 19 month old is having a seizure or a temper tantrum?</subject><content>My son started crying uncontrollably, a high pitched whine that I hadn't heard before. It lasted about 5 minutes, and during that time, any attempts to console or hold him made things worse, he would shrug away from me and flinch or try to hit me if I touched him. I've never hit him, so it's not like he thought he was in trouble. He was completely unreachable- he wouldn't listen to me or respond to any questions, but he didn't hold his breath or pass out, and his eyes didn't roll back or anything. Leaving him alone worked best. I really just think he was mad at me because I wouldn't let him have something, but there was no warning, and it was very upsetting. Usually, if I tell him he can't have something, he will at least insist before he gets really mad. This was more like he pointed at something, I said no, and then I was carrying him into the bedroom, and he flipped out. It was so sudden that I really had to think afterward what could have been the trigger for a tantrum...</content><maincat>Parenting</maincat>

<subject>How can you determine if something is blood?</subject><content>While I was on an assignment in Japan, I purchased an old Japanese sword and took it back to the states.  A friend of mine pointed out that on the blade it had dark brownish-crimson streaks along it (like the liquid source was rapidly put on it, much like you would see from blood created by quickly being cut or splashed).  Odd enough, things have been weird around my house since (my wife finally admitted a few things to me that had happened since I shipped the sword back to our house, prior to getting back myself).  Both my pets have been acting up- my dog growls and whines like she's scared at night, both the cat and dog watch nothing like something is there, both watching in the same direction and following whatever it is they see.  Noises are another factor we have heard.  I want to find out just how I can determine whether or not that the sword has blood on the blade (and it's not a small spot, either... most of the blade has it on it).</content><maincat>Science</maincat>

One of his favorite things to chew is freshly clean clothes, especially underware.  No matter where I put the clothes, he finds them and chews them up.  I tried disciplining him, but I guess the taste of my clothes is too good.  I have tried changing detergents and fabric softeners.  Nothing works. Is there anything I can add to my laundry that will make him not want to chew my clothes?  Is there any kind of additive I can add to the wash cycle that will end his chewing?

<subject>How does faith in god differ from believing in Santa Claus?</subject><content>In my earlier question "does god exist?", the overwhelming response was affirmative, though lacking in any rational explanation.  Invariably, the answer was that one should have faith and believe in god, and that\'s that.  &#xa;&#xa;Of course this leads to the analogy of impressionable, gullible children who are led to believe by their parents - their example in early life - that Santa Claus exists, only to discover later on that they were lied to.  Many of these same children were also told by their parents to believe in another myth, i.e. god.  It is baffling that apparently so few of these children have discovered that that yet again is another scam.</content><maincat>Culture</maincat>

<subject>How can I get over my ex-girlfriend?</subject><content>In September, I got out of relationship of 3 years, on and off. This time I don't think it's as likely to be restored. When she broke up with me she told me it was because she no longer loved me. Later, I found out it was because she wanted to date other guys while I was in Korea, one guy in particular. I have never loved anyone as much as her. She was my best friend before the relationship, and I'm having a hard time letting go. I still talk to her as a good friend, but not best friend. I tried dating another girl, but it was a disaster because she was worried about me too much, which stressed me out even more. By saying she was too worried, I mean she completely flipped her wig after not talking for 2 days. What is the best way to get over the breakup with the first girl so that I can manage to date without worrying future girlfriends?</content><maincat>Relationships</maincat>

She lives in one of the other rooms, and there's one more roomie.&#xa;The problem is that I think my bf's mom's taking an advantage of being my bf's mom. She's treating me differently from the other roomie.&#xa;Well obviously there're a lot of miscommunication going on between my bf's mom and me. There's a cleaning routine at home and everytime when it comes to my turn, right after the day I cleaned the kitchen, she messes it again leaving many cut veggie pieces and sauce stains on the floor and asks me if I'm really cleaning. Or leaves step marks on the white floor which we've decided not to walk with shoes on it long time ago and tells me that the floor is dirty. There're lots of bubbles on the wall in the bathroom after she takes a shower. &#xa;I think she's being mean but I wonder that maybe she really doesn't realize what she's doing. Maybe she's doing all these unconsciously.&#xa;Should I tell her how I'm feeling? How?</content><maincat>Business</maincat>

<subject>How do i determine if a painting is a fake?</subject><content>I bought antique italian painting on ebay of a young girl signd by B. Fitz. It is an oil painting on wood with a wooden gold frame. Measures approximately 8"X11". It is really a nice looking little piece and is probably worth what I paid for it. I suspect it is not antique and I can find no information on the artist. The seller says that the info about this obscure artist can only be found in a book that is published annually and reproductions of its content are prohibited. Will only say it was pained in 1896 or 1897 and was purchased from some european estate. I say "likey story"! I think it is a nice little reproduction. Either way, I like the painting but would like to know its origin so if I want to sell it I can at least be truthful to the buyer. Any information anyone can give me would be gratefully appreciated.</content><maincat>Arts</maincat>

<subject>How do you remove wallpaper?</subject><content>When my boyfriend moved into his apartment in July, we painted a couple of rooms and put up a wallpaper border as a chair-rail in another.  He's moving earlier than expected (next weekend instead of August) and has to remove the border and repaint the walls the original color.  The paint was really dark (red and navy and hunter green) and we're using Kilz to cover it.  But we're having a hell of a time getting the border off.  What is the easiest (and cheapest) way to get it off.  We've tried soaking it with water, and that has taken most of it off, but there are some parts that just won't budge.  The was the first time either of us have put up wall paper, and we didn't really know what we were doing when we put it up, and we didn't really think about taking it down at the time!  Any advice would be greatly appreciated!</content><maincat>Home</maincat>

<subject>How can people not believe in God or a higher power?</subject><content>People recognize that they are living and part of that is dying. People strive to be happy. They hope for the best, and when things go wrong unbelievers are the 1st ones to say, "God damn it." If it is human nature to sin, and human nature to survive, human nature to be happy... How does believing in God hamper that? It doesn\'t. You can still be the imperfect person that you are today and believe in God. You don\'t get into Heaven by the good things you do, because for just as much good you do here you do that much bad (that is also human nature). It is just as bad to lie as it is to steal. So, in that it doesn\'t even "cramp your style" why do people that strive for happiness opt for negtiveness by still not believing. It doesn\'t hurt anyone to be positive. To follow the ten comandments. To have some faith. To be the above average person that gets to live the above average life in Heaven, for just believing, and living your life asking for forgiveness for the bad things that you\'ve done</content><maincat>Culture</maincat>

So after my B.S. in WI, I moved to IN for my M.S. at Purdue.  Then moved to Greater Chicagoland for a couple years at a horticulture company doing systems admin &amp; product management.  I got laid off and my social life sucked so I moved up to Minneapolis which is 2 hours from family and I had a friend or 2 up here.  Well now I'm here, 2 years in customer service (no horticulture jobs here except ones that have you working crazy hours in spring/summer which takes up a chunk of the best part of the year here).  I feel lost and lonely.  Not dating anyone, jobs does not make me feel successful (have been applying all over the metro area), and I really am not enjoying the cold even though I've grown up here.  I want to be near family, helps w/ the loneliness... but warmth is good and so is horticulture...could move south, or move to WI for hort job.  Thoughts?</content><maincat>Health</maincat>

<subject>How can someone regenerate his/her brain?</subject><content>It is a well-known fact that "extacy" users damage and eventually lose their serotonin neurons. Those neurons that do not die, are still severely damaged and lose their axons, and thus their ability to communicate with neurons downstream. There must be a way to promote axon growth in those neurons which are not dead, but are simply "de-axonized". &#xa;   One possible method is to take Inosine, a supplement that is readily available at any vitamin shop. Inosine has recently been shown to regenerate axons in damaged spinal cord neurons in mice (in vivo!), when administered parenterally. Of course this is a long way from human brain neurons (administered orally), but there is still a chance that this may prove to be somewhat effective.&#xa;   Does anyone know of, or can anyone suggest another possible method? Any feedback will be greatly appreciated. Thank you.</content><maincat>Health</maincat>

<subject>How can I force myself out of my slumber during a dream?</subject><content>I think this is a very wierd thing I can do and I want to know if anyone can explain it to me. If I am dreaming and I know I am dreaming and want to get out, I have to kill myself in some way (last dream I fell from a stair case from the top floor of a mansion) and first I will swirl and get dizzy then I will wake up. There is also another way to wake up when I know I am dreaming, and that is trying very very hard to open my eyes wider than they already are in my dream. I have to try multiple times to get this to work and for times it doesn't work, the dream shifts to another situation in a completely different setting, like changing a channel. I also want to know why I forget dreams very easily for the times I do not know I am having a dream. The only way I will remember I had a dream is when I have a de ja vue of some sort comming from one of those dreams.</content><maincat>Health</maincat>

<subject>How do I deal with my 18 yr. old daughter's lying 21 yr. old boyfriend? (Says he doesn't have a problem)</subject><content>He lies about almost everything - what he has done for entertainment, what he has accomplished in school, cars he has owned, his deductions on filing taxes, etc.  He lived with us for 6 months so he could save money to return to college and asked for our advice (that's how we discovered some of his lies).  Instead of saving any money, he blew most all on eating out while on the job, buying frivalous luxuries, cell phone bills.  NEVER took our daughter out on a real date.  Now he's back in college on a loan taking minimun hours, doesn't work, car is broken down.  Our daughter attends college and works.  If they go out on a date, she pays for everything.  We have told her how we feel about him but that it's her choice to see him.  We felt by now she would have realized what a liar and mooch he is and ended the relationship.  She is incredibly kind hearted and feels he is the way he is because of lack of parenting and that he will change.  What can we do?</content><maincat>Parenting</maincat>

But that was 1 and a half years ago. Its been about a month now since she broke up with me, and I have had good days and bad days.  But what is most difficult for me is that sometimes when I see her at work, it makes most of my recovery effort go out the window.  Especially now that I found out that she had moved on and got into another relationship already.  I really want to move on as well and stop this torture, but my mind keep playing this game in my head into thinking that perhaps one day we'll get back together.  Everytime I thought I am breaking through, there's always something in my mind (like old memories etc) that keep pulling me back in.</content><maincat>Relationships</maincat>

However, greed, poverty, and ignorance continue to conspire at such a large scale that it seems degradation will continue, despite education efforts, until critical habitat is lost, biodiversity is lost, and ecological systems will collapse into dysfunction causing tremendous human suffering.

Then I went home for a year with no definite plans of returning. I didn't expect it (though I'd hoped), but he kept in touch. Now I have moved back to that country (for reasons unrelated to him!) and we are together again. We never really talked about the status of our relationship and I'm getting curious. How do I find out without asking too directly? I don't want to ask because I don't want him to think I moved back for him. Even worse, I'm not sure how serious I want the relationship to be and I'm afraid he might ask (and that we might not have the same answer). I've tried just ignoring it, but people are starting to ask me what's up and, honestly, I want to know too.</content><maincat>Relationships</maincat>

<subject>How do I find love as an 18 year old gay man in WV?</subject><content>I'm an 18 year old gay man living in a small town in West Virginia. I'm a freshman in college and completely out. I'm fairly masculine and can't particularly stand the more effiminate gay men. Plain and simple: I'm ready to settle down. I want love. I don't want dating or flings or one-nighters. I've had those in the past and not once did I enjoy the experiences. I want love. But I don't know where to look to find it. It's challenging when you're attracted to men that aren't obviously gay, because I'm afraid of hitting on a man that is straight. That won't blow over well... It's challenging because even though I'm ready for something permanent, I'm still only 18... Any suggestions?</content><maincat>Relationships</maincat>

<subject>How do I know if I should drop my best friend of 11 yrs?</subject><content>It seems like we were better friends in elementary, middle, and 9th grade. But now I feel like we\'re strangers. I found out last year that she had been lying to me about something for about 2 yrs. and I used to be able to confide in her but its like now she doesn\'t care about any of my problems. Also I didn\'t have any friends in school and she\'s always making a mean comment about it. And I was a tomboy when we were younger and about five months ago she said that I would have been gay if it wasn\'t for her. I told her that just because I was a tomboy doesn\'t mean I was gonna be gay I have never been attracted to girls. But its like she just disregards anything I say. I feel like I work harder at this friendship than she does. I also just found out this year that she lies about a lot of things. She is also very judgemental. And in 12th grade she had sex with a guy that I really liked and was like "oh I forgot". Then they started dating and she\'d bring me around when she was with him.</content><maincat>Relationships</maincat>

<subject>How do you choose a husband between two great guys, both with their pros and cons?</subject><content>One of the guys is 19 the other is 23. I've known each about four years. I'm seeing one guy who doesn't have a job or a diploma. But when we met there were fireworks. I felt like our souls touched. We have a lot of things in common and I live with him. I've been dating him for 3 years. The other guy I met at work, working with the mentally handicapped. We were in the same training room together and I had a crush on him from the start. One of my friends knew that I liked him and asked if I cared if she dated him. Course I said go ahead. And then I tried to get over my crush. I distracted myself from him only when he left work for vacation or something. He was gone at least 6 months. I got the boyfriend I have now. When the guy from work came back, my boyfriend and I were on a break. So I hung out with him and we became close. Hopefully I gave enough details to help you make a choice.</content><maincat>Relationships</maincat>

He has severe anger management problems and what seems to be mental instability.  He has rubbed feces on the bathroom wall, he has put feces on my couch, he has put feces in the kitchen trash, he pierced his own lip and ear with a safety pin, he has put a knife in my face, and  threatened to kill me, just to name a few.  He also has an eating disorder and constantly lies.  He has threatened suicide several times.  His father and I can't do anything with him but file criminal charges.  He is so stubborn.  Any attempt at discipline just leads to more violence and more altercations.  We have done all that the law will allow. Social Services tells us that there is nothing they can do because he is not in danger.  His probation officer only says that he is sorry.  The Commonwealth of Virginia will not let the police do anything when I call them because he is a juvenile. Our marriage and lives are in jeopardy.</content><maincat>Parenting</maincat>

I was wondering if there were any tips anyone can give me, on how to make him listen.  He will listen when its just me, but when there are other people around he doesnt listen very well.  Also I donno if its cause hes testing me or what, but i would just take him out &amp; he would go to the bathroom, &amp; hes out there for like 10 min, &amp; like after hes back in the house for like 5min he would go to the bathroom on the floor...I just donno how to get him not to do that.  Also i cant let him outside with out a leash or him being on his zip line b/c he run all over the place &amp; down the road.

<subject>How do you tell if a girl wants a serious relationship?</subject><content>Im not looking for a serious relationship, just a friend who I can enjoy sensual and sexual relationship aspects with. I feel I can be more intimate within a monogomous relationship rather than going home with all the women who are interested in me at random clubs. &#xa;     I guess the word got out that I am looking for a "girlfriend" because more women than usual have started to pursue me recently. They all know I dont want a serious relationship, so I think some of them only tell me they don\'t want a serious relationship either so that I would consider dating them. They probably expect me to \'fall in love\' with them if I date them. This won\'t happen. I don\'t want to have somebody get too emotionaly involved with me and have to deal with letting them go. I don\'t want to hurt people.&#xa;     What can I look for, so that I can be sure they are looking for the same type of relationship as I am? That is, monogomous, but most likely without any longterm future.</content><maincat>Relationships</maincat>

A day after surgery, my ankles, feet, and legs swelled up to the point that my skin felt stretched and tight.  My ankles look like grapefruits and even my toes are swollen and hard to bend.  I have had my husband massage my feet and ankles and that has provided temporary relief.  However, nothing much else, even propping them up, seems to get rid of the fluid.  I thought that it would subside within a few days but it is only a tiny bit better after a week.  I am drinking lots of water and breastfeeding often.  Any suggestions on how to relieve this swelling?</content><maincat>Parenting</maincat>

<subject>How do you totally eliminate pet odors from your carpet?</subject><content>I own two cats, and I live with my dad and sister, and we are going to shampoo the whole house in about a week. I was wondering what I should use for eliminating the odors because last time my dad called a service he used this crappy lemon shampoo, and it didn't even help at all, and the house still smelled. I heard vinegar totally takes the smell out of carpets, but I'm not 100% sure. I also went on Petsmart.com, and they recommended PetZyme which takes all animal odors out of carpet, but I really don't know what to trust at this point. Any help or tips would be much appreciate, thank you.</content><maincat>Pets</maincat>

<subject>How do I deal with the depression and grief due to the death of my mother?</subject><content>I am 36 years old and have two daughters, ages 10 and 5. I recently lost my mother to breast cancer in Sept 2005. She was 55years old. Since the passing of my beloved mother,  I have found it VERY difficult to live life. I have not accepted her death. My mother was the backbone of my families entire existence. Her and I were extremely close. She was and is my bestfriend. I am overwhelmed the pain of not having her around to talk with, laugh with. Somedays I can not find the energy to get out of bed. So therefore I don't. I keep telling myself that the passing of time should lessen the pain. It hasn't. I feel just as desperate and devastated as ever. Honestly it feels it is getting worse. I am suffering from nightterrors. I have completely isolated myself from everything and everyone.  My question is what can I do from here? I cared for my mother until her last day. In my mind I still haven't accepted her passing. I feel almost suicidal @ times.</content><maincat>Health</maincat>

<subject>How do you stop dog aggression on a leash?</subject><content>Socialized in a 6 week puppy class at 10 weeks old.  He plays with other dogs of all ages at the barn, but was fearful of them at first. Now he is part of their pack. Very friendly with people. Gets excited when he sees other dogs during our walks, but should that dog look at him or bark, the aggression starts with the hair raising and growling/barking.  He is kept on a loose leash during approach, but as he lunges of course I have to pull him back.  He is kept at the heel position during walks.  Have tried to keep his attention on me but no luck. I tell him to "leave it" and keep walking but he doesn\'t let it go. I am afraid of making it worse if I reprimand him. He is a 9 month old neutered Ger. Shep.</content><maincat>Pets</maincat>

I got her fixed and declawed. I also have another cat who is older by probably a month. I don't know if my new cat is happy. Her and my other cat get along and play, but when she meows, it's a different tone and it sounds sad. I can't tell if she is genuinely happy here. My other cat is very outgoing and likes to hang under me all the time. My new cat is like the typical cat, meaning she kind of does her own thing and doesn't need to cuddle. I can't tell if she is happy. I try to show her just as much attention as my other cat, if not more, but I'm worried that she doesn't like it here. I also do not know for sure if she was really a stray or if she actually had a real home before I found her.</content><maincat>Pets</maincat>

All the while the news was broadcasting these images of an apocalypse like situation in New Orleans.

<subject>How do you deal with loneliness after relocating to a new place?</subject><content>I've relocated about 4 times now and it never gets easier.  I can make friends, and can have enough things to keep me busy, but still I feel alone and unfulfilled.  The loneliness leaves me depressed relatively often.  How does a person get over those feelings?  The times I feel like this is when I'm not doing something...but I don't want to just keep myself busy and never try to find a solid fix for it.  Is what I'm feeling normal?  Who out there has gone through this and found the light at the end of the tunnel.  It has me considering relocating back to home...but I don't think I like the idea of being away from home and exploring new things just because of these feelings.  So basically, &#xa;1) I feel lonely often, even being busy weekends with friends and have some things to do after work sometimes&#xa;2) I have desires to move somewhere warmer, but am not excited about relocating again and losing the friends I already have here (been here 2.5 yrs)&#xa;3) Moving home has no jobs for me...</content><maincat>Relationships</maincat>

<subject>How can I stop my son from getting out of child restraints?</subject><content>My son is 18 months old and ever since he started walking it has been impossible to keep him restrained. He climbs out of his stroller all the time. We try to let him walk as much as possible when we go out but this isn't always convenient. I even resorted to taking the stroller to our local army disposal shop and having them rig up an extra harness but that only worked for a day or so before he figured out how to escape from that too. Even more worrying is that he now knows how to undo his seat belt in the car. I was driving along the other day, took a quick look at him when we were at the stop lights and he had almost climbed out of his carseat. Has anyone else had this problem? I'm worried that he is going to seriously hurt himself, I'd be grateful for any tips.</content><maincat>Parenting</maincat>

They only care about how much wealth they can accumulate by bending the law to accomodate large corporations (especially the big oil companies like ExxonMobil). They display their allegiances to big business almost daily and are not shy about it. Though, shockingly, the so-called "liberal" media never almost never reports on it. &#xa;&#xa;What is it about these people that causes you to give them your undying trust? &#xa;&#xa;Or do you just like being screwed in the rear while you go about your life in ignorant bliss?&#xa;&#xa;I\'m dying to know.
