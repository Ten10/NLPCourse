The car is not currently running, but I am slowly getting there.  However, when turning the steering wheel, the tie rods bump against the oil pan and wheels only can turn a small amount.

<subject>How to end a 2 year relationship after the love and excitement are gone...?</subject><content>After 2 yrs &amp; 3 months w/my gf I have lost the same feelings I had for her when we first met and even up until the past 3 months. We are both extremely busy with work &amp; school and we hardly see each other. The excitment and lust have fizzled and all we seem to talk about is small talk. We don't have fun like we used to and I just don't feel the same love for her that I once did. I don't see a future with her and I want to end the relationship. She is overly emotional and I know it will end in tears and loud sobbing. I have a heart and know that I should end it now before I make it worse and I think the best way is to just be honest with her. I guess I just wanted to hear other people's opinions.</content>

I have done all the exercises. Spinning, running, weight training you name it. I had one trainer tell me that I will never see results because I am building muscle on top of fat. I eat healthy, I am not a bag of chips, box of cookie kind of girl. The weight issue has gotten worse since I turned 34. I am now 80 pounds over weight. But because I can exercise and go to the gym etc, I am not a candidate for any kind of weight lose surgeries. The doctors tell me that I am to healthy. (go figure) I have tried every diet. Even the Sonoma diet. None worked. Help?? I have poured buckets of sweat with Richard Simmons, and Billy Blanks. I have done it all!!!  Now I am getting ready to give up!!! I just want to weigh 130 pounds, that is my wish for this year...PLEASE HELP!!!!</content>

<subject>How to stop hair fall &amp; hair thinning problem?</subject><content>I am a 20 year old boy from goa-india and i am having trouble with my hair. My hair is naturally very soft &amp; smooth but there has been tremendous increase in hair loss for past year.My hair started to fall maybe about 3 years ago but it was just minor but now suddenly it is at a very fast rate.My hair is perfect on the side parts and also behind the head and also on the front of head but the problem is on top of the head or middle of the head and around crown of the head.That's where i am losing lots of hair.What should i do to stop it? What is the reason for the hair loss? How can i regrowth the hair? I have recently showed it to a dermatologist who has told me to use MINTOP FORTE(MINOXIDIL TOPICAL SOLUTION USP 5%).He has told me that it is a slow process and it would take around 4 months to see the regrowth effect but he didn't told me reason for the hair loss.Is the solution prescribed by the Dermatologist an ideal and perfect for me? Is it a good solution for hair problems?</content>

I think there are jobs in searching the internet for information.  What other type of resources would I use?  The library will always be necessary in an aid to find information.  I know a some things about using the word "database" in a search engine.  I know about the free encyclopedia wikipedia.  Are there other free encyclopedias?  I know about dictionarys online.  I know about www.netlibrary.com, only this site is a pay service for nonstudents.  I prefer free information.  Or atleast information for a nominal fee, such as the cost for a courtesy card at a university library.  Discussion boards seem invaluable for finding about those little tidbits that seem to conflict our lifes.  My main go is to find legitamite educational resources.  What other types of search engines exist for finding out specific information?  There must be a private information database somewhere on the Internet?thanks</content>

<subject>how do you go on dates and hook up with someone when your dirt poor or just want to have sex?</subject><content>I don't make much money, no transportation besides my brother or other family members who may be nice enough to give me a ride.My brother is very protective of his car, so there is no way I could borrow it for a date. What options is there for the guy who wants to give any women in his life everything but has nothing but himself(literally) to give? Espically when in order to be able to survive I have to live with my Dad,Brother,and Sister. Seems pretty pathetic but all I want is to hook up with someone for at least a couple of hours for some good sex on a regular basis. I know how to give a relaxing massage and can be pretty open-minded on various topics. I feel for me to really be able to move on with my life I need the emotional support of a woman. I want some one I can trust and can be straight up with me and not play games. You know the type of games that end up stressing a relationship out and makes both sides miserable. Plus I want a woman who has no problem having sex at anytime</content>
<subject>How do I make a guy to "open" up?</subject><content>At the beggining we were just "casual" and "having fun" as he said! I knew that but I got to a point(after 4 months)that I wanted more from him.It just didn\'t feel right to get with him just for sex.I told him my thoughts and feelings.He said that we were gonna talk soon....it has been 2 months now.Since then we talked on the phone about irrelevant things.He called me one day insisting to get together(that was 2 months after I saw him last).I went over derermined to talk to him. We ended up having sex again, and I honestly felt that he gave me a little bit more of himself and his feelings.We didn\'t talk about the main subject though, which is what HE wants!We are both over 30 and he is the 2nd guy I\'ve been with.I don\'t have a big experience and I realy do not want him to feel I am putting the knife on him.How can make it easier for both to express his feelings(whatever those are !!!)?</content>

<subject>How to ask for money instead of gifts for your wedding?</subject><content>Me and my fiance\'s primary goal is to save enough money for our own place.  We wish to have our guests give donations of money to maybe a mortgage bank under our name, but are not sure about how to do this.  We are both Chinese and it is within the guidelines of our culture to receive "red envelopes" that contain money during major celebrations like Chinese New Year or Weddings, but we don\'t want to offend any of our guests that may not understand our request. So, I have 2 questions: &#xa;&#xa;1. How do I word this on our wedding invitations (do I include something like "We would like your contribution to our wedding gift to go toward our dream house."?)&#xa;&#xa;2. Is there another way to go about this or is this just not a good idea?  Honestly, we really don\'t need anything from Crate &amp; Barrel or any of the other registries and I don\'t think it makes any sense to register and then return everything later for money. &#xa;&#xa;Please help.  I\'m really at a loss as to how to approach this.</content>

She'd call me to retrieve a file. It didn't make sense to me because she'd set the file down and continue the visit for about 30 minutes before she gets to the work relating to the file.&#xa;&#xa;On one occasion, the hall was filled with co-workers either waiting for the copier--or--engaged in short discussions about a project. As my manager came out her office, I met her in the hall to ask a question about vendor. She kept walking. I called her name. She never turned around. As she got closer to the payroll manager, she made a comment that caused the payroll manager to laugh.&#xa;&#xa;I respect authority; but, people in positions of authority should consistently demonstrate professional maturity to acquire and maintain respect from subordinates.</content>

I dont hav enuf info 2 try a "sec of state" corp ck &amp; the service may nt B in my state or even in the USA, but being in the dark when the matter is so vital 2 me &amp; culd cost me both $$$ &amp;/or my health, if they were a rip off, I\'d like to find SOME info on a serv or company that deals with the public. Any ideas or suggestions?</content>

<subject>How do I keep my cockatiel from breaking his tail feathers during night frights?</subject><content>My cockatiel is just like many other cockatiels aka it gets extremely scared at night when something bumps and rubs against the cage. He trys flying around his cage which is big, but filled with toys because he has free range of my room. While trying to fly around the cage away from the "thing" he breaks a tail feather in half. It doesn\'t fall off, it just snaps. He looks really pitiful and the broken ones seem to get stuck or in his way. Therefore, I trim the tailfeather right above the broken part. Is this the right way of going about it or should I wait until the feather falls out? Oh, and the night frights have decreased in number because he know has a lava lamp night-light to allow him to see in the dark.</content>

<subject>How do I get in better shape without much activity?</subject><content>I sort-of hate exercise, so going out running is something I know I won\'t do. Also, the gym is a no-go because the gym at my college is overcrowded and I can\'t stand being around so many people, also I have absolutely no time for it. I don\'t really know ways that I could do something good for my body in my room in minimal time.&#xa;&#xa;Also, what kinds of diet is appropriate for vegetarians? I like cooked vegetables, but I am really not into raw. A lot of the time I eat cream soups (cream of broccoli or potato-leek), cereal with soy milk, pb&amp;j, and starches. I cut out desserts for the most part, but I eat yogurt still. I don\'t think my diet is inherently bad, but I was wondering if there was a way to diversify it in a way that stimulates my metabolism and balances me out nutritionally.&#xa;&#xa;I\'m not very overweight, maybe 5 pounds, but I have gotten substantially "bigger" size-wise in the last 6-8 months -- I was a size 4-6 and now I\'m an 8-12.&#xa;&#xa;I feel horrible about the way I look, what can I do?</content>

I am a very shy, young-looking 33yo guy with a shocking history of getting with girls, and I don't want to face another rejection.</content>

Republicans are spending $$$ like there's no tommorrow. Democrates tend to vote like Republicans (until this year, as a whole,they have supported the President like a bunch of lap dogs). This year, Democrates seems to have collected their courage and are standing up to the Executive Branch (even Republicans are standing up to Bush now!) &#xa;&#xa;Even if I don't like our President, I pray that he gets the courage and stop dishonoring to our country and tell the whole truth and ask for forgivness like a true Christian would. &#xa;&#xa;I really wish that Bush would lead our country away from foreign oil dependence. The fact is that the past five Presidents have said this and did nothing. I hope this Bush can honour his promise and really do something to get America out of the mess he got us in.</content>

If you rape someone you don't want to be raped.  You get raped by a gorilla (this is less than an eye for an eye, but  we'll figure something out), and if you messed up someone face because you decide to drink and drive? ...well you do the math.</content>

One of them is THEIR addiction to oil, not the everyday consumer. We have no CHOICE but to use oil. If the government really cared, they would ban all oil-based motors and introduce electric cars or water-fueled cars. But that would kill the oil industry - an industry that kills the Earth! And an industry that causes war! They don't care, they're making money!) we will be able to easily terraform Mars over a couple human generations and we'll be just as good. Don't they realize that Mars is now a DEAD planet that does NOT support life!? If we can't get along as a race on our OWN planet, are we really going to be successful Are they just saying these things because they  ONLY care about they moneymaking endeavor in their own lifetime? This topic is deeply saddening when you think of the current status, but humans can perform great things when they work together...let us care for Earth.</content>

While setting up the movie I can see my desktop on the TV so I know it's working.  Once I start the movie I can see the movie on my PC but not on my TV, but I can still see my desktop elements on the TV.  It is my guess that the video is playing back at over 450 lines of resolution which my PC can display with no problem but my TV can't.

<subject>How To Groom a Shih Tzu?</subject><content>What is the best way to groom a Shih Tzu?  Considerations are: 1. not spending too much money, 2. how frequently should the dog be taken to a groomer for a trim, 3. we do not want very long hair on the dog, 4. we don\'t want to spend a tremendous amount of time grooming the dog each day.  The most challenging area to keep groomed on our dog seems to be his face and eyes.  His eyes get that "brown stuff" in them.  And, his mustache grows long and gets "yicky" since he loves to chew rawhide.  Thanks for any advice.</content>

<subject>how can I help a friend that is in a very frightening situation?</subject><content>She has been married for 10 years and for the past 3 years she has been trying to get away from him because he is abusive.  He dont physically attack her, though he has before, he mentally abuses her and controls her very badly.  He has cheated on her, he takes off and leaves her occasionally to be a rock star, but he expects her to be there everytime he comes back. She wants to leave him, but he will do everything he can to ruin her life and he already uses the kids against her.  They separated once before and he left took everything, she is afraid of that again- she dont care about any of the possessions, but the kids are what she is terrified about losing. I tell her that these are all temporary problems that may have to be endured at first but will change with time- I even offered to help her with whatever legal resources she needs.  How can I convince her that she CAN live a happy life?  She dont have to live miserably with this jerk forever.</content>

<subject>How can I get my 3 year old dog to poop outside?</subject><content>We just adopted a 3 year old male Puggle from Petsmart a week ago. He is not housebroke. I am home with him all day and let him out several times a day. He eats plenty, but won't poop outside. At first he wouldn't pee just mark. I have had to leave him 2 times but for no more than a hour and both times he pooped in his cage. He had a good vet visit (he's very healthy) and they said he is not constipated. He has only pooped 3 times since we've had him. The first time was in the driveway right after we got back from the vet and had everything under the sun stuck up his butt so I think it just stimulated him to go. I have a 3 year old busy body and don't like leaving her alone in the house while I stay outside with the dog for however long it takes until he goes. I usually give him 15 min then bring him back in and back in the cage he goes. 1-2 hours later I try again. I would love to be able to praise him for going to show him it's good, but I need him to go first. Please help.</content>

<subject>How do you live with someone suffering from chronic pain?</subject><content>My husband has been suffering from chronic pain for the past few years.  It can be very depressing to be around.  The pain has become a third person in our marriage.  He has taken antidepressants but they have sexual side efects. A lot of times I feel like he\'s mad at me but he isn\'t.  It\'s just the pain consuming his life.  The kids think he\'s always in a bad mood.  I asked him how he was this morning and he snapped at me asking "how does it look like I feel??"  &#xa;&#xa;I understand the "in sickness and in health" part, but at some point do I start to feel resentment for not being happy as well?&#xa;&#xa;I made a mistake and had an affair, but am in the process of ending that. He\'s just as miserable and depressed about the state of his life (no job, no $) as my husband is. Are all men this miserable?&#xa;&#xa;Any ideas on how to cope? I don\'t want to resent him later in life for taking all the happiness away.  I\'m in my mid 30\'s and this has been going on for 4 years.</content>

<subject>how to stop heart disease/chest pain?</subject><content>Hi, I am an overweight (220 pound) 34 y.o BW with chest pain. happens several times a day since I started using my elliptical 2 weeks ago (since stopped). There are 2 kinds of pain: pain when I breathe and pain that starts with a "pop" or spasm underneath left breast in middle of chest then pain radiates down left arm to my fingers, throbs for awhile and then with aspirin goes away until I move suddenly or breathe deeply/or in cold weather. I have had this problem several times in the past 10 years and have gone to the ER each time only to be told I don\'t have a heart condition; but I do have consto-chondritis (which doesn\'t explain the pop and radiating pain, but only the pain in the middle of my chest). Could I still have heart disease that they aren\'t seeing &amp; if so what can do to stop it? what tests should Dx be running? I am eating right and was exercising, but I\'ve stopped using the elliptical because of this. also have some edema/hiatal hernia. EKG/slight arrhythmia=Dx said ok</content>

<subject>how to straighten hair?</subject><content>Hair straightening irons are best for getting the kinks out of hair&#xa;&#xa;without using chemicals. They work very well. The only issue to be&#xa;&#xa;aware of is that the constant use of such irons can dry out your hair&#xa;&#xa;quite quickly, causing broken or "fried" ends. Use a good conditioner,&#xa;&#xa;and see if you can go a few days without washing and straightening.&#xa;&#xa;However, they may not work if your hair is extremely short.&#xa;&#xa;&#xa;&#xa;Otherwise, there are several effective daily straightening balms that&#xa;&#xa;can smooth your hair without, hopefully, causing scalp irritation.</content>

He\'ll share just about anything, and he misses his brother when he\'s gone even though when he\'s here it seems like he fights about 50% of the time.</content>

<subject>How to generate these famous multiple sources of income?</subject><content>There are always these advices that to get financially independent you should set up multiple sources of income that create money on their own, with only minimal intervention from your side. &#xa;&#xa;The people who give these advices are always saying you've got to try out a lot and yada, yada they now make 1000s of dollars per months with these things. But they're not very clear on what actually really brings in the money?&#xa;&#xa;Or with which money you should survive during the time where you're figuring out your grand scheme of multiple sources of income ...&#xa;&#xa;So, does anyone have real suggestions and examples for creating additional sources of income? Online and offline. And I'm not expecting high value income right now, it would already be cool to see a steady $10-$20 income stream being viable. Thanks a lot.</content>

Last night I asked him if he would not drink so much and he agreed.  When he went outside to walk our dog, I saw he was drinking a beer.  When asked why he did after saying he wouldn\'t his answer was "I wanted to"  I felt as if I\'d been lied to and think he may have a serious drinking problem. He\'s a great provider, is wonderful to my family (mother, son, grandchildren), gives me anything I want and is obvious in his love for me.  He doesn\'t understand why his drinming is an issue with me, but I\'ve never known anyone who drinks every day and consideres a six pack and a couple of shots "a couple of drinks."</content>

I started hanging with a much older crowd.I was getting into 21 and up clubs, and parting on party buses with lots of wealthy and fun people. My girls and I made it a habbit to go out every night of the week for like 2 months straight. I was drunk most of the time, and making a really bad name for myself, People soon started talking badly about me, and spreading false rumors. I came to the point where i noticed what i was doing was not right, I was ready to have a good man in my life but no one would even think about taking me seriously.Luckily I have one now and im doing great. But i would still like to go out on the weekends without hearing things or noticing people noticing me in a bad way, I just want to show everyone that I have changed and that everyone makes mistakes.</content>

<subject>How can we get more money from the college for my son?</subject><content>my son will enter college next year.  He has recieved appx 10,000 in scholarship money.  That leaves his mom and I with a balance of about 26,000 to come up with a year.  His mom and I are separated pending diverce and the financial aid pkg is based on her income.  She is a lawyer who makes too much to qualify for little if any financial aid.  My son is a terrific wrestler who will wrestle for his school next year, however it is a div 3 school so sports money is not available. Could someone tell me if it is unusual to talk to the finanial aid people or the wrestling coach after the aid decision has been made?  Do I have any other avenues to explore to get more money for my son? To come up with 26,000 a year is a stretch for his mom and I. Please advise</content>

<subject>how to clean berber carpet?</subject><content>i purchased berber carpet for 2 large rooms because i was told it was so easy to clean - just use bleach and water - this does not work.  the retailer i purchased it from said it is because it is not "real" berber - the synthetic fibers actually permanently bond to the dirt or stain.  (they claim they didnt know this at time of my purchase) i can use various carpet cleaning products and it will look clean for about 24 hours then the stains magically reappear.  bleach doesnt work - i even tried it FULL STRENGTH without results.  this was not cheap carpet - on the contrary was quite expensive and now looks absolutely horrible and it has been down for only a year.</content>

<subject>How do you keep your hair perfect and no split ends?</subject><content>I've never dyed my hair or done any chemical services on it or anything and it's usually really soft and healthy but it also has a little bit of split ends every now and then, and it really annoys me because I'm striving for perfection.  I don't use hot styling tools, and I let my hair air dry everyday.  I don't brush it when it's wet, and I carefully comb out the tangles a little bit so it looks under control.  I want my hair long by graduation, so I don't want to keep trimming or cutting it because my hair doesn't grow very fast.  Since my hair is layered, the longest tip is mid-back, but I want it to be long - waist length by graduation this June (4 months from now).  I know that it will be that long because it grows 1/2 inch per month... so it will grow about 2 inches more by graduation... but how will I keep my crowning glory healthy and glowing while it grows long like I want it without it getting split ends???</content>

<subject>How do I lose excess belly flab after weight loss?</subject><content>I am a 29 year old male, 6\'2", who weighs 240 pounds.  I started at 260 a few months ago and my goal weight is 190.  I know from experience that this weight I\'m losing is going to leave me with some flab that\'s not going to go anywhere unless I do something to target it.&#xa;&#xa;Right now, I\'m concentrating on cardio stuff (excersise bike 45 minutes 6 days a week) and a healthy diet.  It\'s working great.  I\'m not interested in getting a six-pack and being on the cover of GQ.  I just want to lost the excess flab on my belly when all the fat is "emptied."  Can I do this along the way?  Situps and crunches haven\'t worked and I\'m not interested in surgery.&#xa;&#xa;Any suggestions?&#xa;&#xa;Also, what does one do about....manboobs?</content>

<subject>How would i do TPCAST on Ted Kooser\'s poem "Applesauce" T-title P-Paraphrase C-Connotation S-Structure T-Title</subject><content>I liked how the starry blue lid of that saucepan lifted and puffed, then settled back on thin hotpad of steam, and the way her kitchen filled with the warm, wet breath of apples, as if all the apples were talking at once, as if they's come cold and sour from chores in the orchard, and were trying to shoulder in close to the fire. She was to busy to put in her two cents' worth talking to apples. Squeezing her dentures with wrinkly lips, she had to jingle and stack the bright brass coins of the lids and thoughtfully count out the red rubber rings, then hold each jar, to see if it was clean, to a window that looked out through her backyard in to Iowa. And with every third or fourth jar she wiped steam from her glasses, using the hem of her apron, printed with tiny red sailboats that dipped along with leaf-green banners snapping, under puffs of pale applesauce clouds scented with cinammon and cloves, the only boats under sail for at least two thousand miles. &#xa;&#xa;TPCAST on this POEM.HELP!!!</content>

<subject>How can you find out if a vet is ripping you off?</subject><content>I have a vet and he seems to really care about my pets, all six of them that I take to him.  But at the same time it almost seems as if i am there every damn week.  I can't keep going back to him all the time because I can't afford it.  His prices are really reasonable and he has 3 different offices.  I hope he is not just fixing them temporarily and making me keep coming back cause they never fully get rid of this.  All four of the cats have been battling the ear mites and upper respitory infection, but when he tells me they should be fine, in about 2 weeks they are showing signs of it.  He never gives me enough medicine to get them completely over it, but maybe he knows what he is doing.  Also, does anyone know of any medicine for ear mites for cats or the upper respitory infection that i can buy somewhere online or in a pet store without having to go to the vet?  &#xa;&#xa;Katie</content>

<subject>How do companies get their satellites into orbit?</subject><content>Like cellular phone companies, satellite radio companies, and internet service providers... &#xa;&#xa;Also, how do they know where to position the satellites?  Do they ask the government?  Where are political boundaries in subspace and space, if any?  Is it getting crowded up there?  Could one satellite steal information from another satellite?  Could satellite information be stolen from earth as communications are transferred (such as bank acct. #s, passwords, usernames, addresses, social security #s, etc.)?  &#xa;&#xa;What about sabataging another country's spy satellites?  Why would one country allow itself to be spied on?  How many satellites are in Earth's orbit currently?  Does the Unites States know when any country is sending a spy satellite into orbit?  &#xa;&#xa;How much does it generally cost to send a satellite into orbit (have an example)?&#xa;&#xa;Any answers or links you have to these questions would be most helpful, thanks.  I am very curious about just how the world of satellites works...</content>

<subject>How does one overcome bad feelings of screwing up your adult son's life when he was a kid by divorcing his dad</subject><content>Two years after divorcing his father because his father wouldn't spend anytime with either of us, I remarried to someone who had a son close to the same age around 10yrs old. Unfortunately, both boys were as different as night and day. My son quiet and reserved the stepson an attention getter and allways the center of attention good or bad. Now they are both grown and on there own, I cain't stop feeling that I screwed up my sons life because I divorced his dad leaving him without a father except for a step father who never showed him any attention and a half brother who is actually closer to his step brother then him. Is there anyway to stop the pain and quilt of past mistakes. After contacting his real dad trying to reunite the two of them,his dad still will not get in touch with him just continues to make up excuses and says he has tried in the past leaving voice messages but never received any return calls from his son. Why want he just call his son again now that I've contacted him</content>

I Googled those words and came accross this on lightplanet (however I have never heard of John Walsh and want something more authoritive. Perhaps the ("I have a question" section of an Ensign):&#xa;&#xa;W. John Walsh&#xa;&#xa;By revelation to the Prophet Joseph Smith, the Lord stated that members should pay "one-tenth of all their interest [increase] annually; and this shall be a standing law unto them forever." (D&amp;C 119:4) Present Church policy specifically states that no one in the Church has any authority to interpret this revelation for another person (See Financial Clerk\'s Handbook).   This prohibition applies to everyone, including Stake Presidents and Bishops. If a local Church leader instructs you how to calculate your tithing, then he is in violation of this policy. It is up to the agency of each individual person to determine what constitute\'s a fair interpretation of the revelation.</content>

He can open the fridge and bring whatever you desire and he picks up the trash on the floor and puts it inside the trash can.

My son has worked on the hot air balloon puzzle for hours but has not been able to solve the puzzle. I hate for him to be so discouraged that he will not try another one. Is there a website or book that shows the answers to this one puzzle? It may help him understand how it is done so he can complete the other puzzles he has.&#xa;&#xa;Thank you for your help!</content>

<subject>how can i help my daughter learn in school?</subject><content>my daughter is in kindergarten for the second time and is considerably slower than the rest of the children, and they want to hold her back again. my daughter has a medical condition that makes her a little bit slower. i recommended that the school put her in a special education class. first they give her a test but when the tests results come back they said that she was below grade level however her score was not low enough for her to be in special education classes. by the end of the school year my daughter should know a total of 100 sight words as well as her number words 1-10 and her color words. so far she knows all her color words and number words but maybe only 10-15 of her sight words. the teacher has told me many times to study with her for an hour an evening, every other day. i have been studying them with her every night for 2 hours! can i go against the teacher and get her in a special education class?</content>

I was never told sorry for not being called(I had to call to get results)I was then told all tests were negative for anything, but when she went to hang up, she said "Oh. Hold on a second. I just flipped the page. Nobody called you? Someone should have called. Are you sure nobody called? It looks like you have GBS.Are you sure nobody called? I\'m going to call in RX. If you don\'t feel better by Friday, call us. Thanks for calling." I didn\'t feel any different by Monday, so I called them. They said "There is no physical symptoms of GBS. Are you pregnant?" I told them i wasn\'t unless they didn\'t tell me I was. She said she would pass the message to the doctor that I was having other symptoms and "she\'d call me back in a little while". Now it has been over a week since that conversation and still nothing from them. I am now going to a new Gyno to be examined AGAIN to see if they even got the test results correct.&#xa;" "=I qouted them word for word</content>

<subject>How do I get my husband to "fall in love" with me again?</subject><content>My husband and I have been married for 5 years.  As with any marriage we have had our problems.  For some time we have not been affectionate with each other.  He doesn\'t hug me affectionately and I don\'t initiate those emotions as well.  I feel like most of our problems stem from a lack of respect and affection toward each other.  2 weeks ago, we both came to a point that we couldn\'t live like this anymore.  But, I had a change of heart that I couldn\'t let him go either.  I wanted him to love me and love on me and not anyone else.  I still have feelings for him and get a thrill when he hugs me or holds my hand.  He has built a wall up and doesn\'t initiate these feelings, even though we agreed that we were going to work on this.  He says he is basically going thru the motions, even though a lot of the "in love" feelings are not there.  Should I be very affectionate with him and be more assertive?  How do I recreate that "in love" feelings with him.  Any ideas wil be welcomed!</content>

And her teats are getting longer/bigger, but only the ones in the back so far are hard and feels like a big lump. She always slept when she comes into the house but now she will sleep all day or all night and not move unless I do.  And now she just wants to sleep on the couch or the bed and she didn't before.  She's a shepard/boxer mix if that helps.</content>

<subject>How would liberal media report Bible events ?</subject><content>once heard someone take Luke 19:3, which says, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could not for THE PRESS\xe2\x80\x9d and say that, \xe2\x80\x9cthe press was keeping folks away from Jesus 2000 years ago and they are haven\xe2\x80\x99t stopped yet.\xe2\x80\x9d I had to say \xe2\x80\x9camen\xe2\x80\x9d right there. Without a doubt, today\xe2\x80\x99s media is as biased and slanted and left-leaning as it can possibly get away with being. The thing that makes it so sickening is they pretend to be impartial and fair when it\xe2\x80\x99s obvious that they have a liberal agenda. &#xa;Can you imagine what the headlines would be if certain Biblical events were written up by today\'s liberal media? On Red Sea crossing: WETLANDS TRAMPLED IN LABOR STRIKE \xe2\x80\x93 Pursuing Environmentalists Killed. On David vs. Goliath: HATE CRIME KILLS BELOVED CHAMPION \xe2\x80\x93 Psychologist Questions Influence of Rock. On Elijah on Mt. Carmel: FIRE SENDS RELIGIOUS RIGHT EXTREMIST INTO FRENZY \xe2\x80\x93 400 Killed. On the birth of Christ: HOTELS FULL, ANIMALS LEFT HOMELESS \xe2\x80\x93 Animal Rights Activists Enraged by Insensitive Couple. On feeding the 5,000: PREACHER STEALS CHILD\'S LUNCH - Disciples Mystified Over Behavior. On healing the 10 lepers: LOCAL DOCTOR\'S PRACTICE RUINED \xe2\x80\x93 "Faith Healer" Causes Bankruptcy. On healing of the Gadarene demoniac: MADMAN\xe2\x80\x99S FRIEND CAUSES STAMPEDE Local Farmer\'s Investment Lost. On raising Lazarus from the dead: FUNDAMENTALIST PREACHER RAISES A STINK Will Reading to be delayed. &#xa;&#xa;Often I hear a news report or listen to the results from a certain CNN Poll and I can\xe2\x80\x99t help but wonder if anyone else sees the prejudice and one-sidedness of the report. Clearly \xe2\x80\x9cTruth is fallen in the streets\xe2\x80\x9d. If it\xe2\x80\x99s any consolation, it\xe2\x80\x99s good to know that God is keeping record and that the lies and deception will one day be judged. David prayed well when he wrote in Psalms 31:18, \xe2\x80\x9cLet the lying lips be put to silence; which speak grievous things proudly and contemptuously against the righteous.\xe2\x80\x9d The dominant major media is not going to present the truth in a manner that will be fair or impartial. They are not looking for the truth they are seeking to further their cause. Christian are you like the media? The Bible says in Proverbs 12:22, \xe2\x80\x9cLying lips are abomination to the LORD: but they that deal truly are his delight.\xe2\x80\x9d The media\xe2\x80\x99s day is coming but the day of judgement for a lot dishonest and distorting believers is also coming. The media is guilty of majoring on anything that they can even suppose about those who do not take their side on moral issues while they cover up and don\xe2\x80\x99t report crimes committed by those who support their liberal agenda. I marvel at believers who do the same thing. My heart breaks when I hear a man of God criticized and castigated knowing its only because he\xe2\x80\x99s thundering out the truth in areas that would seem to convict and condemn the sin that so many are falling prey to while the same people bend over backwards to defend and over overlook the obvious inconsistencies and compromises and deviations from the truth about some other leader who is more in line with their persuasions. I guess media bias extends beyond the media. Perhaps we should check ourselves for bias before we condemn the media.</content>

<subject>How do I install interior basement perimeter french drains and sump pump basin?</subject><content>I am attempting to install about 90 feet of french drains along the interior perimeter of my basement directing torwards a sump pump basin. I have already used a laser level to find the low spot (pump location) and have a pretty go idea about the layout of the system. &#xa;&#xa;The plan was to create an 8" wide ditch (8" to 10" deep) along the perimeter and fill with gravel and corrugated 4" drain pipe. There is a "cloth wrap" available that installs over the pipe to prevent dirt and debris from ever clogging the pipe perferations. &#xa;&#xa;Once the pitch is established the pipes will be directed into the sump pump basin. The sump basin is a standard "sump pump basin" from Lowes or Home Depot with a 1/2hp pump with float auto-activation.&#xa;&#xa;When everything is put into place, I will back-fill with more gravel and then patch trench with cement leaving a 1/2 inch gap along the wall for any water from the walls to drain in to.&#xa;&#xa;I need help on the proper tools and prep work as well as supplies to use.</content>

The lighter accepts little or no fuel and will not work from that point forward.  This has happened with more than 5 different lighters from different sources.  What am I doing wrong?</content>

<subject>How do horoscope makers take into account the latitude (not longitude) of the place of birth of a person?</subject><content>A horoscope is prepared based on the view of the sky from the place of birth of the child at the time of his birth. But the sky looks different from different places around the world. A horoscope based on a book showing planetary positions (known as "Panchang" in India) in one part of the world will not be correct for preparing horoscope for a person born in another part of the world. While the differences in longitudes are supposedly taken into account by adjusting the time of birth taking into account the time difference between the two places (the place to which the Panchang belongs and thje place of birth of the person for whom a horoscope is to be prepared), there seems no way of taking into account the difference in the latitudes of these two places. So, do horoscope makers take into account differences in latitudes or don;\'t they. And, if they do, how is it doen?</content>

I learned that lesson. I lied about the cheating to the new girlfriend, a few times. I also spent some time with my ex talking about our breakup, but I didn't tell the new girl about it. She's really upset and hurt, and has every right to be. I've been dishonest with her.&#xa;I know that I'm going to be faithful and honest from now on. How can I get her to trust me again?</content>

<subject>how do I know if my apartment was once a drug lab?</subject><content>We got to see our place in mid-clean up.  The carpet was only one year old and had black tracks where the previous renters had walked in every room.  The bathtub was solid black on the bottom of the tub with a thin, almost crusty, layer of something strange.  Also, the fireplace had an unusual rack laying on top of what holds the logs in the air.  It would be perfect for cooking something on, and I once used that type of corrigated metal in a chemistry lab.  Whatever the black stuff was, it was on the bottoms of the renters feet or shoes and I suspect that it came from the fireplace somehow.  I havent noticed any weird smells except for the first time we used the fireplace, which my dad said was normal when a fireplace hasnt been used in a while.  I am worried that my husband and I are at risk.</content>

So I won't push her if she feels scared of that.&#xa;She has a little potty-train seat. She sits there with a book, and then opens the thing and puts her stuffed animals in it...lol&#xa;She doesn't give me the impression that she knows when she's dirty or when she has to pee or anything. &#xa;Should I just let her be and try again in a few more months? &#xa;She's almost 2 and half, but I wanted her to be potty trained before she turns 3.&#xa;Any good advice that has actually worked for you? &#xa;Please, don't give me advice from a book, I've read them all. I'm looking for genuine answers, things that actually worked with your own kids.&#xa;Thanks a lot!  ;)</content>

<subject>How do I decide who to go out with? (read details before answering.)?</subject><content>The first girl is bi. She has decided she would save herself for me, and only date women until I'm ready. She's beautiful, but that action alone kinda worries me that I'll only disappoint. The second bi girl has liked me for almost a year. She's kinda emo and I've saved her from committing suicide a few times. If I disappoint her I'm afraid of the outcome. The final bi girl was a lesbian, but claims that I am different, so she'd change. She has been raped 4 times in the past 2 years, her parents abused her as she was growing up, and has many physical disabilities now. She's already going to be moving in with me so that I can get her away from those issues. The first straight girl, is a single mother. She's beautiful as can be, has a great personality, but she's Canadian, while I'm American. The location creates a bit of an issue. The second straight girl wouldn't normally be my type, sorority girl that's big into typical college life. She parties a lot, but is as beautiful as the prev.</content>

<subject>How do I adjust the clutch pedal on an '88 Jeep Wrangler?</subject><content>I have a 1988 Jeep Wrangler who recently had the tranny rebuilt.  Everything worked great.  Then, I put on some new pedal pads (gas, brake, and clutch pedals--better grip when driving with wet feet) and a floor mat.  Now, I have to press the pedal *into* the floor to get the clutch to disengage/engage.  I'm wearing a hole into the floor mat because of how far down I have to push it! ...and a lot of times it actually gets STUCK on the floor mat, which is dangerous.&#xa;&#xa;I'd really like to adjust my clutch *just a little* so I can still drive it with the accessories I put on.  Cars I've had in the past had simple ways to to do this...but I can't see how to do it on my Wrangler.  I've tried looking in a repair manual and online but haven't found anything yet.&#xa;&#xa;Does anyone know how to adjust it?  I would think there *has* to be a way...&#xa;&#xa;Thanks,&#xa;Dan</content>

<subject>How do I handle a very extreme crush on a woman at work?</subject><content>I am 42 (man), but look much younger, she is the receptionist at my work (29). She is the most beautiful female my eyes have ever seen. She\'s quiet, sweet, and everyone in work likes her alot. When she first started Jan 3 we talked quite a bit. I got this crazy idea she might want to go to lunch with an ugly short piece of crap like myself. I have not had a date since May of 1983, and thought I would ask her to lunch. She said "um, not right now, maybe when the weather gets better", and a few more excuses. This crushed me but I expected it anyway. Then, she told a coworker that she thought I was a "nice guy", but wasn\'t interested in me whatsoever. When I hear that it has made me so depressed I cry in work, after work, and sometimes at home. I wish in complete honesty that at this point I don\'t want to live, period. I\'ll never get married or have kids, so whats the point? How should I handle this? Should I be friendly to her?, or try to avoid her?</content>

<subject>How did the water come into existance that is mentioned in Genesis 1:2 in the bible and when or what day?</subject><content>Genesis l:2 says the spirit of God was moving over the face of the waters or some say above the waters. Where did that water come from and how did it come to be. Is it a result of something of is it a created entity by design. Its seems that all has a cause and all causes have a result. Likewise it seems there is a price and a by product in all that is done. Is this water a by product that was designed to be the source of all. It is also written that the water did contain the earth for it is written that the earth came from the waters by means of the waters. Seems rather amazing. Of course it is stated all things do come from or are sourced in God so how, when, why, and which way. Can't find anyone talking about it.</content>

<subject>How do you heal a busted toenail?  Do I need to see a foot doctor?</subject><content>Warning: this question is not for the queezy reader, and contains graphic details.  I do a lot of social ballroom dancing, and once in a while mishaps happen.  A couple months ago somebody stepped on my second toe on my left foot, and the skin underneath the toenail became bruised and purplish.  A few days later after the bruising pain stopped, it developed into a scab underneath the toenail, causing the nail to have a higher left-to-right curve over the toe.  When I clip my toenails every week or so, the scab never seems to grow out.  The toe has no pain whatsoever, but I'd like to remedy my toe's appearance to it's former beauty.  Should I bandage it, manicure it, have a doctor see it, or what?  I'm worried that the toenail is no longer going to grow straight anymore now that I've cut off so much of the mis-shapen excess parts.  If the toenail is mostly removed, do you know if it will eventually grow back again?  I would like to know more about the way toenails grow in general.</content>

Could it be I have a crappy digital camera ( only some pictures have come out perfect) or am I doing something wrong -Are there different rules in taking good digital pictures than of those with 35mm&#xa;-If I do have a bad camera (Hyundai 5.0 megapixel w/zoom &amp; video) - are there any gadgets or anything I can buy to attatch to my lens to make the pictures more crisp and have better clarity - or should I just get a better camera -the one I have was a present from my Fiance.</content>

<subject>How to manage a broken relationship?</subject><content>I am a married lady..with lots of problems at home..with a horrible hubby..absolutely loveless marriage. Fell in love with a married man on the net. Beginning it was a fairytale story. I really enjoyed his company very much. Ofcourse I would have never left my family but these days I find his attitude changed towards me. Lies a lot which through someway....the truth comes out. Might be this happens to show me the reality of life..but I get hurt when it happens. I know him so much that I can sense his every feeling very well. He doesnot answer my calls..my sms..avoids seeing me. I have to keep calling him to answer my calls. The problem is he should tell me the things more clearly instead of avoiding me like this. Atleast I feel knowing my difficulties he should have been more patient with me. I feel like ending myself. I love this man so much.</content>

<subject>HOW Can I STOP my NEARLY 2 year OLD WAKING up EARLY !?</subject><content>My son is 2 next week and hes always been a good sleeper, but ive noticed in the last month hes started waking up at 4am or 5am and isnt wet or needs anything, he just lays there for about an hour moaning to himself.  I put him to bed at 8pm every night and he has a cup of milk and a biscuit just before.  And on the mornings he doesnt wake that early, its just as bad as its between 6.30am and 7am and thats it then, hes awake.  Im a single parent so coping with this on my own.  Ive tried not giving him a nap in an afternoon or giving him not as much or a bit longer etc, i think ive tried everything!  Ive put him to bed later and earlier but he still does it. Am i just going to have to put up with it or has someone else gone through this?</content>

<subject>How do you break up, and stay broken up, after six years dating a girl?</subject><content>Looking for real advice.&#xa;Adults 23+ ONLY please, no point-chasers!&#xa;We have been together since I was 20. We don\xe2\x80\x99t have any kids (hell, we have never even had sex), but staying away after breaking up is really difficult, not because there is this passionate love there, because there is not anymore: it\'s more like I get lonely or bored and start to remember the good things I will miss about the relationship, so we end up back together. &#xa;I constantly want to look at, talk to, and be around other women, besides the girl I am with, but I haven\'t ever cheated on her. &#xa;Perhaps the worst of the matter is that after we are done making out recently, I feel sick; then she tells me "I love you; that is why I do this, because I love you and I want you to be happy" and it makes me feel even worse. I know I sound like a horrible guy, but the whole situation is more complicated than this 1000 letter question will allow me to explain.&#xa;Is there any delicate way to just end something after six years?</content>

<subject>How do I help a lovestruck friend?</subject><content>A good friend of mine is stuck on a girl. Sounds great, right?...Far from the truth. Throughout their realationship, she did so many things to hurt him that I can't even count the times. Now, she dating someone and still stringing my friend along. I've tried talking to him about it, but I don't get anywhere. He's constantly defending her actions. I was at the point where I was saying 'He'll just have to learn the hard way.' But now, I'm starting to worry about him. He's becoming more and more depressed, so much so that it's starting to affect his performance in collage. I can't help but to worry that he might do something to himself if she ends up totally blowing him off, which I suspect she will do. I don't know how to get through to him that she just isn't worth it. Am I right to think that, and to trying to get him over her? If so, any advice on how to do it? Many thanks for replys.</content>

<subject>How do I get the burnt cat food smell out of my oven?</subject><content>So you ask, "How did cat food get into your oven"?  The short story is that a mouse decided to take up residence in the insulation in the bottom of my oven.  (Goes to show how much cooking I do)  Naturally he needed to eat and apparantly liked the brand of cat food we were buying.  Now I understand why the cat was starving each morning.&#xa;&#xa;I fired up the oven on 2 separate occasions, once to cook and once to run the self-cleaning cycle only to have my house fill up with smoke -- I even got a short flame in the oven, yikes!  We were puzzled bec. there was no evidence in the main compartment of the oven indicating a source of the smoke or flame.  It wasn\'t until my husband took apart the bottom of the oven that we found our fury friend\'s provisioned, bachelor (or bachelorette) pad.&#xa;&#xa;Let me tell you, refried catfood is one nasty smell.  I was thinking of using baking powder and vinegar to scrub the inside of the oven but wanted to check with all of you first.  Thanks for your suggestion</content>
<subject>How can I begin writing for a magazine? I write short stories, "opinion" pieces, advice, and adult erotica.</subject><content>I have been told all My life I Am a good writer by friends, teachers, and strangers alike. I could write for a column  perhaps (even on whats sometimes considered "controversial" subject matter). I Am a woman and a freethinker very familiar with MANY woman\'s issues especially in the new millennium, which also include parenting. My erotica is good too.

No matter how often I tell her she\'s beautiful, or really thin, she doesn\'t believe it.  In fact it usually ends in her getting mad at me.  She eats really healthy foods, and excersizes which is good for anyone, but she also takes diet pills, which worries me.  I feel like no matter what I say or do she won\'t change.  I feel this could eventually lead to something bad.</content>

<subject>How to get LEGAL revenge on an ex who has really hurt our son, i.e. just cut off his health ins before surgery</subject><content>Our son was born with a congenital condition that has wreaked havoc on every system in his body. He is now almost 20 and for the second time in his life, had to have braces in prep for jaw surgery. Because our son would not give his dad the "total respect" he literally DEMANDED (our son told his dad "respect is earned and you haven\'t earned it"), his dad cut him off financially. This kid has had braces for for the last three years for the second time in preparation for surgery to alleviate TMJ and an underbite. Now there is no health insurance for his adrenal insufficiency or surgery, no tuition, no child support. Our son is a fulltime college student, so he can\'t work fulltime. I can\'t afford tuition or health insurance on my own. I couldn\'t even afford a lawyer to fight the b*****d. My son is devastated. I can\'t rest until the dog gets his due. What can I do to get revenge that won\'t land me in jail? I will NOT DO ANYTHING ILLEGAL. Any help?</content>

The issue is removing the assembly in the first place -- the manual indicates that there is a snap in piece of plastic locking the entire assembly in place, but the actual car does not match the images in the manual, and there is a large piece of plastic which spans the entire width of the car. This piece of plastic appears to be secured with plastic nail-shaped plugs that don't seem to want to come out without being broken (probably single-usage snaps meant to be replaced). Do you know how to remove the assembly in the first place to access the rear side of it?</content>

<subject>How can I increase my semen production naturally or medically?</subject><content>I know that these things go down naturally with age, but when I was under 25, I was like a animal.  I could have 5 big orgasms a day or more.  It was actually almost too much.  I couldn't  even concentrate on studying or anything without thinking about girls/sex.  Then, when I was about 28, I took some Propecia (don't ever tak this stuff, take my advice, the labels are inaccurate) while I was taking it, my sperm/semen level went down to almost nothing.  &#xa;&#xa;I didn't worry about it too much because at least I could think straight for the first time since puberty. &#xa;&#xa;I took it for about a month, and then my testicles shrunk and it felt like I was just dead down there.&#xa;&#xa;Obviously, it wasn't worth the trade off.  I stopped taking it but I only recovered about 20%.&#xa;&#xa;This was 7 years ago.  I have tried exercise and multi-vitamins, but I didn't really get the results.&#xa;&#xa;What I feel like I need is a jump start.  I need some medicine, or natural cure, just to get it going again, to 50%.</content>

<subject>How should I allocate ING 401k?</subject><content>I'm 24 years old and work as an IT Consultant.  My firm has a 401k plan with matching with ING.  My company matches half of my contribution, up to 3% of my salary.  Therefore, I am planning on contributing 7% to take advantage of the match.  My question is, how do I allocate my contribution?  ING offers a variety of funds and labels them as Global/International, Aggressive Growth, Growth, Growth &amp; Income (Stocks), Growth &amp; Income (Stocks &amp; Bonds), Asset Allocation, Income, and Stability of Principal.  Since I'm still young, I'm looking for a more aggressive strategy - slightly higher risk but higher estimated return.  Any advice in the form of percentages of contribution would be very helpful.  Thanks.</content>

<subject>How do we tell our hearts what to do?</subject><content>Ok this one is kind of long but a genuine end of the rope desperate don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do kind of problem. For confidentiality sake I\xe2\x80\x99m going to say that I have this friend who we are going to call Max and Max has a friend named Laura. Max and Laura have been very good friends for a long time now and just recently got together. Some time around the beginning of their friendship they pretended to go out just to play with their friends heads and they developed feelings for one another but didn\xe2\x80\x99t admit it. Max pushed Laura away and she was very hurt but they continued being very good friends and even became best friends all the while Laura was madly in love with Max but didn\xe2\x80\x99t say it, Max loves Laura but no where near as much as she does him in fact he pretty much feels like she\xe2\x80\x99s a best friend type of girl and maybe a little more than that but not what she wants from him now. Laura eventually got another boyfriend we\xe2\x80\x99ll call Kevin. Kevin was very bad for Laura, he got her back into something\xe2\x80\x99s that Max had helped her get out of and had her doing things that were not goods for her at all. Max felt very bad for Laura and wanted her to do better but it was none of his business. Finally Kevin ended up in the place where bad guys go and Laura was very hurt, Max was there for her as a friend while she was hurting. Finally Laura admitted to Max that she was in love with him and could never love another, Kevin was only a tactic to make her feel better without Max. Laura didn\xe2\x80\x99t know whether to go with Kevin or Max but Max seeing the chance to help Laura and give her another chance, told her he loved her too. Max only wanted to give her a chance, he loved her but he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in love with her the way she was with him but he wanted to try it and he would do anything to keep her away from that jerk Kevin so he began a relationship with her. The thing that influenced Max the most was that Max has always wanted love and never received it from anyone and to see the way she was so in love with him just intoxicated him but he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make himself love her like that no matter what and Now Max feels very guilty and has no idea what to do. Should Max tell Laura how he really feels? What would happen to her if he did? Why can\xe2\x80\x99t Max love her the way she deserves to be loved? What to do? Please help.</content>

My lot also borders a small plot of trees, but there were no toadstools within this patch of woods.&#xa;&#xa;I have no reason to expect that these will not return this year, but I thought I'd ask if anyone has encountered such a problem, if there is anything that will get rid of them, or some early treatment that helps subdue them.&#xa;&#xa;Is there a fertilizer mix that is preferable? Maybe use NO fertilizer at all? &#xa;&#xa;Any ideas please?&#xa;&#xa;:)&#xa;&#xa;Thank you ---</content>

Is this after the mutual fund mangers take the expenses (it says that the total expense ratio is 1.97%)?  Also, how much of the return is based on the price increase? How much of the return is based on the dividend? Also, what will be the "after-tax" return if we assume a certain tax rate? &#xa;&#xa;Furthermore, is there a mutual fund screener that can find the mutual fund based on the return after expenses &amp; taxes? Today\'s mutual is based on the average return published by the mutual fund, right? I don\'t even know whether these are pre-expense or pre-taxed. Pointers are greatly appreciated.</content>

<subject>How do you release of lonliness after you've lost the one you love?</subject><content>I find the hardest feeling to deal with, after having lost a long term relationship, is that of lonliness. I believe it is the reason I have tried so many times to put back the pieces of my own broken relationship. To comfort myself when feeling lonely, I strive to make it go away... easiest and quickest resolve seems to be "making up". After 4 years together, 2 of which I have spent with diamond on hand and planning a marriage, I\'ve come to terms and decided to allow our love to die. No arguments, no battle of who is right or wrong, just an end. There are times when being alone in a room is torturous, at best.  Times when the lonliness enters so deep, so strongly, the feeling causes my body to ache, as if I\'m sick inside, right down to the core. I\'m not certain what triggers this feeling... However I am very aware that I must do away with it, allowing peace in my independence. Any ideas of how to release of someone, the memories, and the heartache of saying goodbye? (Thanks...)</content>

<subject>How do I go about buying an REO Repo house?</subject><content>I'm interested in buying a Repo (in the banks possession) but have never bought a house this way and was wondering what the best way to go about it is.  The asking price for the house is $406,000 which is around market value, but the house is in disarray and would need all new carpet, new paint, and some drywall work and replacing of fixtures.  I'm tempted to just put in a lowball offer but think it might be helpful if I knew what amount of money the bank is trying to recover, what repo fees they want to recover, and what the real estate agent who is selling the house expects to make as commission so I can make the lowest offer possible without getting blown off. Any suggestions on how to proceed?</content>

Some people he works with and hangs out with there smokes. He called me one day to say that since he\'s been around other smokers, he\'s given in again to smoking....I\'ve never smoked, so I don\'t know how difficult it is to stop. When I try to approach him about how much it bothers me, he gets a little irritated, and says that I "don\'t understand how hard it is to quit" and that he\'s trying to quit....how can I help him or make suggestions to him to quit smoking for good? being around smoke makes me cough a lot anyway....I don\'t want to date a man who smokes, but he\'s such a sweetie and I think I\'ve fallen for him. Should I just give him time to prove that he\'s trying to quit, and cut him slack? HELP!</content>

He had a really bad relationship with his family so he never really got the chance to tell them about me. But one day about 4 months ago he tells me that his family is making him marry another girl. i was really pissed off at first, but he said it wasnt his fault, it was his parent idea. and becuz of a "certain situation" that i\'d rather not say, he had to listen to his parents.And like a dummy, i just let things slide. But now he\'s with this girl and they\'re married now, but he still wants to be friends with me. He says im still his best friend.At first he would call me and tell me about how annoying this girl was and that he would rather be with me, but as the weeks go by, he slowly starting to tell me about how much she does for him and im kinda jealous. but im tryin to be a good friend to him and just listen, but it really hurts because i still love him. i know i sound so stupid, but i cant helpit</content>

<subject>How to lose weight after birth?</subject><content>It's been two months now since I had a baby boy. I'm am trying to get back to my pre-pregnant weight.  I only have about 8 to 10 pounds to go but I seem to be stuck!  I've dieted sensibly.  Taking about 200 to 250 calories out of my daily intake and exercise to burn at least 250 calroies a day.  Supposedly that is suppose to equal 1 pound per week of weight loss.  When I had my daughter 4 years ago the weight came off right away and I was back into my normal pants in no time.  But this time..... Well this is depressing.  Anyone else in the same boat?  Any suggestion on how to get past this hump?</content>
